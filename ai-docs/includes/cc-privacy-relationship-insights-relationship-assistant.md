By enabling the Assistant insights based on exchange, limited exchange data, which includes a sender's name and email address as well as excerpts of the email body, are retrieved (but are not stored in [!INCLUDE[pn_dynamics_crm](pn-dynamics-crm.md)]), for the purpose of showing relevant insights of your email. Further, the Assistant can be configured to retrieve information with regards to news and flight information,  by sending out requests to Bing (which is not considered [!INCLUDE[pn_ms_dyn_365](pn-ms-dyn-365.md)] Core Services). An administrator can enable and disable the Assistant by navigating to **Settings** > **Sales Insights**, clicking the **Assistant** tab, and then making the appropriate selection.
