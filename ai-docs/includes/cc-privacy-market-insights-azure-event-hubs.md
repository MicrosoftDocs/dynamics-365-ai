By enabling Market Insights to connect to [Azure Event Hubs](https://docs.microsoft.com/azure/event-hubs/event-hubs-about), you will allow social data to be streamed to event hubs using automation rules. Azure Event Hubs stores the social data streamed from Market Insights for a [pre-configured period of time](https://docs.microsoft.com/azure/event-hubs/event-hubs-faq) and any application that can listen to the event hub will be able to access, store and/or process this data.  
  
 Note that the social data sent from Market Insights includes information regarding the social post (author and text) as well as enriched information such as Language, Location, Sentiment, Tags, etc. For complete information on the content of a social post sent to event hubs, please see the [JSON schema definition](../market-insights/event-hubs-json-reference.md).
