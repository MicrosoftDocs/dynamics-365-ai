# Overview about data sources

Customer Insights connects data from a broad set of sources. Connecting a data source to Customer Insights is often referred to as the process of *data ingestion*. After bringing th data into customer Insights, you can unify the data and get a holistic view of the customer data, and take action on it.

You can add a data source via three main ways:

- [Through dozens of Power Query connectors](connect-power-query.md)
- [From a Common Data Model folder](connect-common-data-model.md)
- [From your own Common Data Service lake](connect-common-data-service-lake.md)

> [!NOTE]
> You can't add data from on-premises data sources yet.
