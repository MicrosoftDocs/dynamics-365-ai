# Connector for Azure Blob storage (preview)

Store your Customer Insights data in an Azure Blob or use it to transfer your data to other applications.

## Configure the connector for Azure Blob storage

1. In Customer Insights, go to **Admin** > **Export destinations**.

1. Under **Azure Blob Storage**, select **Set up**.

1. Enter **Account name**, **Account key**, and **Container** for your Azure Blob storage account.
    - To learn more about how to find the Azure Blob storage account name and account key, see [Manage storage account settings in the Azure portal](https://docs.microsoft.com/azure/storage/common/storage-account-manage).
    - To learn how to create a container, see [Create a container](https://docs.microsoft.com/azure/storage/blobs/storage-quickstart-blobs-portal#create-a-container).

1. Give your destination a recognizable name in the **Display name** field.

1. Select **Next**.

1. Select the box next to each of the entities you want to export to this destination.

1. Select **Save**.

Exported data is stored in the Azure Blob storage container you configured. The following folder paths are automatically created in your container:

- For both source entities and entities generated by Customer Insights: `%ContainerName%/CustomerInsights_%instanceID%/%ExportDestinationName%/%EntityName%/%Year%/%Month%/%Day%/%HHMM%/%EntityName%_%PartitionId%.csv`
  - Example: `Dynamics365CustomerInsights/CustomerInsights_abcd1234-4312-11f4-93dc-24f72f43e7d5/BlobExport/HighValueSegment/2020/08/24/1433/HighValueSegment_1.csv`
- The model.json for the exported entities will reside at the %ExportDestinationName% level
  - Example: `Dynamics365CustomerInsights/CustomerInsights_abcd1234-4312-11f4-93dc-24f72f43e7d5/BlobExport/model.json`

## Export the data

You can [export data on demand](export-destinations.md). The export will also run with every [scheduled refresh](system.md#schedule-tab).
