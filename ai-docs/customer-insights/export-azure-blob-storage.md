# Connector for Azure Blob storage (preview)

Store your Customer Insights data in an Azure Blob or use it to transfer your data to other applications.

## Configure the connector for Azure Blob storage

1. In Customer Insights, go to **Admin** > **Export destinations**.

1. Under **Azure Blob Storage** select **Set up**.

1. Enter **Account name**, **Account key**, and **Container** for your Azure Blob storage account.
    - To learn more about how to find the Azure Blob storage account name and account key, see [Manage storage account settings in the Azure portal](https://docs.microsoft.com/azure/storage/common/storage-account-manage).
    - To learn how to create a container, see [Create a container](https://docs.microsoft.com/azure/storage/blobs/storage-quickstart-blobs-portal#create-a-container).

1. Give your destination a recognizable name in the **Display name** field.

1. Select **Next**.

1. Select the box next to each of the entities you want to export to this destination.

1. Select **Save**.

Exported data is stored in the Azure Blob storage container you configured. The following folder paths are automatically created in your container:

- Entities generated by Customer Insights: Dynamics365CustomerInsights/Export/%EntityName%/%EntityName%_%PartitionId%.csv
  - Example: Dynamics365CustomerInsights/Export/Customer/Customer_1.csv
- Source entities: Dynamics365CustomerInsights/Export/%DataSourceName%_%EntityName%/%DataSourceName%_%EntityName%_%PartitionId%.csv
  - Example: Dynamics365CustomerInsights/Export/Retail_Contacts/Retail_Contacts_1.csv

## Export the data

You can [export data on demand](export-destinations.md). The export will also run with every [scheduled refresh](pm-settings.md#schedule-tab).
