# Start your journey in Customer Insights on the Home page

You can [access your Customer Insights](https://home.ci.ai.dynamics.com/) instance after it's created and ready to go. 
The first page you'll see in Dynamics 365 Customer Insights is **Home**. This page shows an overview of your customer base as well as metrics to track the health of your business.

## Explore the home page

Under **Insights**, you'll see tiles with [measures](measures.md). Measures are key performance indicators (KPIs) that you've defined, such as average likelihood of customer churn or average online spend per customer.

The **Potential interests** and **Potential brands** sections help you to gain a greater insight into your customer base by understanding the interests and brands that they have affinity for. This information can be unlocked using the [enrichment](enrichment-microsoft-graph.md) capabilities, after completing the [map](map-entities.md), [match](match-entities.md), and [merge](merge-entities.md) phases.

**Segments** displays groups of customers based on demographic, behavioral, or transactional attributes that you've defined. [Creating segments](segments.md) helps you to better target your business activities.

## Change between environments

Once you've set up and configured [data sources](data-sources.md), you'll want to switch from a demo environment to a live environment. Using the production environment lets you to work with your customers' data. Select the **Environment** control in the upper-right corner of the page to change environments.

Administrators can create and manage [multiple environments](manage-environments.md). Maintaining more than one environment may be useful if, for example, your organization operates internationally and you need to segregate data and insights in different ways.

## Next step

To see your own insights on the home page, you'll first need to [add data sources](data-sources.md) and [unify](data-unification.md) your data to build customer profiles.
