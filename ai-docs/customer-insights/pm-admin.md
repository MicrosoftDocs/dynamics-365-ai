# Admin

The Dynamics 365 Customer Insights administration pages include the **Permissions**, **System**, and **Export destinations** pages. You can access them from the left-side navigation.

**If you are an administrator:**

- You can use the **Permissions** page to give other users across the organization access to Customer Insights. There are two types of access: **Viewer** and **Contributor**. See how they differ by visiting the [**Permissions** section](pm-permissions.md).
- You can use the **System** page to give easily identifiable names to your instances. You can also specify a name for your organization and define its region.

**If you are not an administrator:**

- You can use the **Permissions** page to learn what is accessible to you as a user. As explained in the [**Permissions** section](pm-permissions.md), what you can access  depends on whether you have **Contributor** or **Viewer** permissions.
