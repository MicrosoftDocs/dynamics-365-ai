#### System administration

- **Task details pane**

The task details pane enables you to see details about tasks that the system runs. It's a handy way to identify issues with the configuration and find solutions.
Review the error messages see how you address potential issues.
 
- **Processing information added to additional pages**

This improvement adds information about the status of your entities on the **Entities** and **Customers** page.
 
Additionally, you can find details about the progress of processes, along with the task details, on both of these pages.

- **Improvements to system status page**

We improved the structure of the status details table on **System** > **Status** when reviewing data exports.
 
Additionally, errors in the **Details** column are now more detailed and actionable. 
 
- **Cancel reverts job back to previous state**

When you cancel a task, for example, in the match process, it will revert back to its latest state. For example, if the Match process completed yesterday and you cancel it today, it will revert to yesterday's successful state.

## June 2020 updates

The Dynamics 365 Customer Insights updates in June 2020 include several features, performance upgrades, and bug fixes.

### New and updated features in June 2020

#### Enrichment

- **Enrichment with company data from Leadspace**
  
  Define fields in unified customer profiles that are used to look up related company data from Leadspace. After running the enrichment process, B2B profiles are enriched with additional attributes including company size, location, industry, and more.    
  This collaboration allows you to improve the quality of your data with input from third-party services. To use this enrichment, you'll need a license from Leadspace to access its B2B company data. Customer Insights will use that license to keep your data enriched continuously.    
  For more information, see [Enrichment of company profiles with Leadspace](enrichment-leadspace.md).

- **Enrichment hub page**

  All available data enrichment from first- and third-party enrichment providers gets configured in the same place. Configuring data enrichment is a seamless experience that is managed from a common place.    
  For more information, see [Enrichment for customer profiles](enrichment-hub.md).

- **Separate brand and interest affinity enrichment**

  The brands and interests affinities are now available as two independent enrichments. Separated enrichments give you the flexibility to configure and manage them individually, depending on your business requirements or needs.    
  For more information, see [Enrich customer profiles with brand and interest affinities](enrichment-microsoft-graph.md).

#### Extensibility

- **Clickable URLs for unified activities on the Dynamics 365 Customer Card Add-in**

  The unified activities in the Customer Card Add-in are now showing clickable URLs if such URLs have been defined in Customer Insights during the configuration of activities.    
  For more information, see [Customer Card Add-in](customer-card-add-in.md).

- **Brand and interest affinities available on the Dynamics 365 Customer Card Add-in**

  A new control on the Dynamics 365 Customer Card Add-in lets you show brand and interest enrichments on your contacts in customer engagement apps in Dynamics 365.    
  For more information, see [Customer Card Add-in](customer-card-add-in.md).

- **Additional Power Automate triggers**

  We have extended our triggers for Power Automate and added the following triggers:
  - Get a notification or perform an action when an automated full refresh (data sources, unification, segments, measures, exports) completes
  - Define a threshold for a business measure. For example, you can create a notification that gets sent when the defined threshold is passed. Additionally, the trigger brings information that allows you to build more complex workflows in Power Automate.    
  For more information, see [Power Automate connector](export-power-automate.md)

- **Export to Facebook Ads Manager**
  
  This capability lets you export segments from Customer Insights to Facebook Ads Manager. Segments are exported as custom audiences to use unified customer profiles from Customer Insights in Facebook marketing campaigns and ads. The custom audiences are also usable to create campaigns on Instagram through Facebook Ads Manager.    
  For more information, see [Connector for Facebook Ads Manager](export-facebook.md).

#### Predictions

- **Subscription churn prediction**

  Follow a guided experience to create churn prediction in subscription areas like cloud services, customer membership, and other sectors. 

  The subscription churn prediction feature enables you to predict the likelihood of a customer stopping the use of subscription-based products or services without engaging a data scientist. Using the prediction score, you can combine other information about your customers to create segments of high churn risk. With the help of this segment, you can use integrations with Customer Insights to directly target customers in marketing, customer support, and other scenarios to reduce the risk of churn for specific customers to improve revenue and reduce cost.

  Within the experience, you can configure the definition of churn as a time-based window specific to your business. For example, a video streaming business that has a monthly subscription process might want to consider a customer to have churned after 15 days after the expiration of their subscription.

  As you continue through the prediction, we'll guide you through what data is needed, and enable you to map data about your business to fields required to predict churn for your customers. As business information changes, you can also set a schedule to retrain on new information in your system to adapt to changing business circumstances.    
  For more information, see [Subscription churn prediction (preview)](predict-subscription-churn.md).

#### Segments

- **Find similar customers**
  
  Find similar customers in your customer base using artificial intelligence. A binary classification machine learning model assigns a similarity score to customers in the expanded segment. The score is based on the similarity to customers in the source segment. Depending on the similarity score, customer profiles are added to a newly created segment.

  Sometimes referred to as lookalike modeling in digital marketing, it uses an AI model to help find customers who are similar to another segment of your customers by factoring in additional attributes. It not only allows you to pick the attributes but also allows you to specify the maximum number of customers who should be in this new segment. The AI model will then compute similarity scores for each customer based on your selected attributes and find customers with the higher average similarity score. The resulting segment will include customers who look similar to the customer in your original segment.    
  For more information, see [Similar Customers](find-similar-customer-segments.md).

- **Segment overlap and differentiators**

  Segment overlap lets you see how many and which customers are common to two or more segments. For example, how a high-spenders segment overlaps with a high-satisfaction customers segment or how a churning customer segment overlaps with a low-satisfaction customers segment. Additionally, you can analyze how the overlap changes based on an additional attribute of your choice.

  Segment differentiators reveal what differentiates one segment from the rest of your customers or from another segment. All you need to do is identify a segment and the system will identify profile attributes and measures that distinguish the segment in the form of a ranked list of differentiators—from the strongest differentiator to the weakest.    
  For more information, see [Segment insights (preview)](segment-insights.md).

- **Segment lifetime**
  
  Define a schedule to activate or deactivate a segment.    
  For more information, see [Manage existing segments](segments.md#manage-existing-segments).

## May 2020 updates

The Dynamics 365 Customer Insights updates in May 2020 includes several features, performance upgrades, and bug fixes.

### New and updated features in May 2020

#### Data ingestion

- **Real-time data ingestion: history views**

  When using our API to ingest real-time updates, you can see up to 30 days of aggregated history for these updates. You have access to aggregates of all successful or failed API calls including their outcome, source system, and other useful metadata.    
  For more information, see [Real-time data ingestion](real-time-data-ingestion.md).

- **Real-time data ingestion: profile updates**

  This extension of the real-time data ingestion lets you see, within seconds, changes to specific user profile fields.    
  In addition to the real-time functionality for activities, Customer Insights supports low latency updates to profile fields. Real-time updates for profile fields have an expiration time and are therefore not a replacement for scheduled refreshes.    
  For more information, see [Real-time data ingestion](real-time-data-ingestion.md).

#### Extensibility

- **Updated timeline and pagination on the Customer Card Add-in**

  The timeline of the Customer Card Add-in solution matches the activity timeline in Customer Insights. The pagination of the timeline improved, showing up to 50 activities at once. It also allows loading additional activities in the timeline.    
  For more information, see [Customer Card Add-in](customer-card-add-in.md).

- **Power Automate trigger for segment changes**

  Triggers for Power Automate define what you can build a flow from. The newly added trigger lets you define a threshold for a segment. For example, you can create a notification that gets sent when the defined threshold is passed.    
  For more information, see [Power Automate connector](export-power-automate.md).

- **Multitenant support for custom models**

  Configure workflows for custom models with a web service of a different Azure Machine Learning tenant. You can sign in to the Azure Machine Learning tenant from Customer Insights when creating a new workflow for custom models. This capability is an addition to the existing capability of integrating with your own custom Azure Machine Learning web service.    
  For more information, see [Custom machine learning models](custom-models.md).

#### Segments

- **Entity path automation**

  When creating a segment in Customer Insights, users need to define the entity path. This capability takes a first step at automating the entity path definition so you can focus on the segmentation criteria that you have in mind.    
  If the entity by which you want to segment your customers is directly related to the unified customer entity, you won't need to define the entity path anymore. However, if there is more than one possible entity path, you still need to define it manually.

- **Actions on multiple segments**
  
  Users can select multiple segments and take actions on them, like refreshing the segments, with a single click.    

- **Refresh segments**

  Users can refresh a single segment or select only the segments they want to refresh.    

  
- **Improvements to compounded segments**

  Users can create, edit, and delete segments that are based on other segments. For example, a segment constructed on another segment that was constructed on a third segment.    

- **Segment list page**

  The new design of the segments page uses a list format that lets you see more segments at once. A search field is added to find segments quickly. Users can now apply actions like downloading or deleting on multiple segments at once. A new trend experience is introduced to quickly identify significant changes on segments.    
  For more information, see [Create and manage segments](segments.md).

#### System administration

- **Customer Insights available in Microsoft Dynamics 365 Online Government**

  With more and more channels for interactions, citizen data is scattered across myriad systems, leading to siloed data, and a fragmented view of information about citizen interactions. Without a complete view of each citizen's interactions across channels, it's impossible for governments to modernize at scale. Microsoft is committed to supporting the technology needs of government to keep up with citizen expectations for consistent and responsive experiences.    
  With 2020 release wave 1, Dynamics 365 Customer Insights will be available for the Government Community Cloud (GCC), an environment built to meet the higher compliance needs of United States government agencies. Agencies gain a unified view of citizens and use prebuilt AI to derive insights that improve interactions, empower employees, and transform communities, while reducing IT complexity and meeting United States compliance and security standards. Dynamics 365 Government meets the demanding requirements of the US Federal Risk and Authorization Management Program (FedRAMP), enabling United States federal agencies to benefit from the cost savings and rigorous security of the Microsoft Cloud.

## April 2020 updates

The Dynamics 365 Customer Insights updates in April 2020 includes several features, performance upgrades, and bug fixes.

### New and updated features in April 2020

#### Activities

- **Map activity entity to standard activity type**
  
  Activity configuration and storage are currently based on a static design to view them in a timeline. The semantic meaning of activities, which has potential for multiple use-cases in AI models, isn't fully used at the moment. We plan to make the activity timeline more dynamic, based on the activity type and better semantic understanding of the activities. This feature aims to identify the activity type as defined in Common Data Model for any ingested activity.
  For more information, see [Customer activities](activities.md).

#### Data ingestion

- **Real-time data ingestion: activities**
  
  Real-time data ingestion provides data immediately for consumption in Customer Insights, until the subsequent scheduled refresh pulls this data from the data source.    
  For more information, see [Real-time data ingestion](real-time-data-ingestion.md).

- **Improvements to data preparation**
  
  Learn more about the data ingested in an entity. With the data summary, you can understand the data quality characteristics that can help to take appropriate action.    
  For more information, see [Explore entity data](entities.md#exploring-a-specific-entitys-data).

- **Ingest analytical data from Dynamics 365 with Common Data Service**
  
  Common Data Service is available as a way to create data sources in Customer Insights. Existing Dynamics 365 customers can ingest analytical entities from Common Data Service to Customer Insights. A single data source can simultaneously use the same Common Data Service-managed lake in a Customer Insights instance.    
  For more information, see [Connect to data in a Common Data Service managed data lake](connect-common-data-service-lake.md).

#### Extensibility

- **Export to LiveRamp**

  Activate your data in LiveRamp® to connect with over 500 platforms across digital, social, and TV ecosystems. Leverage your data in LiveRamp for targeting, suppressing, and personalizing ad campaigns.    
  For more information, see [LiveRamp&reg; connector](export-liveramp.md).

- **Customer Insights Teams Add-in**
  
  The bot provides lookup capabilities for unified customer profiles. It will show a card with up to 15 fields from the resulting customer profile. Multiple matches return a list of results where you can select a profile.    
  For more information, see [Teams bot for Customer Insights](export-teams-bot.md).

#### Measures

- **Measure list page**
  
  Improvements to the measures page include support for actions on a single measure and on multiple measures at once. Additionally, you'll find a search field to find and track measures quickly.    
  For more information, see [Create and manage segments](segments.md).

- **Improvements to compounded measures**
  
  Users can create, edit, and delete measures that are based on other measures. For example, a measure constructed on another measure that was constructed on a third measure.

#### Segments

- **Additional operator**
  
  The In-set operator allows segmentation for customers by several possible string values. Before this operator was added, you had to construct such segments with multiple OR conditions. The In-set operator lets you do that with a single condition.    
  For more information, see [Create and manage segments](segments.md).

#### System administration

- **Copy configuration settings to a new environment**
  
  Copy your Customer Insights configuration from one environment to another. While creating a new environment, you can select an existing environment you want to copy the configuration from. We currently support data sources, data unification, relationships, measures, and segments to be copied. Data source credentials and actual data aren't copied.    
  For more information, see [Manage environments](manage-environments.md).
