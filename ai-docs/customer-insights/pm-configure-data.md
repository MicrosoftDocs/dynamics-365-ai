# Unify

<!--rename file-->

After [setting up the data sources](pm-data-sources.md), you can unify the data in Dynamics 365 Customer Insights. Data unification includes three steps: **Map**, **Match**, and **Merge**.

The data unification process lets you unify data sources that were once disparate into a single master customer dataset that provides holistic view of your customers, a unified customer profile. Unification stages are mandatory and performed in the following order:

1. [Map](pm-map.md)
2. [Match](pm-match.md)
3. [Merge](pm-merge.md)

After completing the data unification, you can optionally

- [set up relationships between entities](pm-relationships.md) to create sophisticated segments,
- [enrich your data](pm-enrichment.md) to get a wider range of insights about your customers,
- or [define activities](pm-activities.md) from some of the ingested attributes.
