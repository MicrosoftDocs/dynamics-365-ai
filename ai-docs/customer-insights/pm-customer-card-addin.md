# Customer Card add-in

The Customer Card enables you to gain a 360 angle view on each of your customers. Once completing the Customer Card installation, you can start using the **Timeline Control** and **Demographic Control** to unlock rich insights on a selected customer, including his or her location, age, latest activities, and much more. Note that a prerequisite to utilizing the customer Card is using the **Search & Filter Index** screen (accessible via the **Customers** page) to index your data. Also note that:
- In order to view customer activities, those should be first defined using the **Activities** screen.
- In order to view customer KPIs, those should be first defined using the **Measures** screen. 

## Requirements

- Dynamics 365 for Customer Engagement version 9.0 and later.
- Unified Interface enabled: Sales Hub, Customer Service Hub, Project Resource Hub. 
- Users who will use the Customer Insights Customer Card in Dynamics 365 for Customer Engagement need to be added as users on Dynamics 365 Customer Insights. You can do so on the **Permissions** page in the **Admin** section, as discussed later in this topic.

## Install Customer Card Add-in

1. As an admin, go to the **Settings** section in Customer Engagement, and select **Solutions**. 

   > [!div class="mx-imgBorder"] 
   > ![](media/settings-solutions.png "Settings solutions")

2. Select the display name link for the Customer Insights solution.

   > [!div class="mx-imgBorder"] 
   > ![](media/select-display-name.png "Select display name")

   If the Customer Insights solution does not appear in your list of solutions, select the **Get Solutions from Marketplace** button above the list. This will take you to Microsoft AppSource. 

   > [!div class="mx-imgBorder"] 
   > ![](media/get-solutions-from-marketplace2.png "Get Solutions from Marketplace")


   In Microsoft AppSource, search for the Dynamics Customer Card and select **Get It Now**. It may take some time for the solution to be installed to your environment. 

3. Here you will configure the overall settings for the Customer Card add-in. The first step is to sign in with the admin Azure Active Directory (AAD) account you use to configure Customer Insights.

4. The next step is to select the Customer Insights instance you want to fetch data from.

   > [!div class="mx-imgBorder"] 
   > ![](media/select-instance-to-connect.png "Select instance to connect to")

5. The last step on the overall setting is to select which field in the Customer Insights Customer entity corresponds to the ID of the Contact entity in your Customer Engagement organization.

6. Select **Save configuration** to save the setting.

7. Next, you will need to assign the following user roles:

   - Customer Insights Customizer: Assign this role to the users who will customize the content to be shown on the card for the whole organization.
   - Customer Insights Card Standard User: Assign this role to the users who will use the card for consumption, but who wonâ€™t customize.
