# Power Automate connector (preview)

Trigger specific events to occur automatically when your data changes and manage more complex flows directly in [Power Automate](https://flow.microsoft.com/).

## Power Automate triggers

You can use a variety of triggers that allow you to create flows to automate repetitive tasks, such as notifications or more advanced actions. 

- Trigger when a data source refresh fails. 
- Trigger when a data source refresh succeeds.
- Trigger when a threshold is crossed on a segment. The trigger is limited to crossing above the threshold.
- Trigger when a threshold is crossed on a business measure. The trigger is limited crossing above the threshold.
- Trigger when a full refresh of Customer Insights (data sources, segments, measures,...) is completed.
- Trigger when a refresh of the unification process (map, match, merge) is completed.

[Configure your triggers in Power Automate](https://flow.microsoft.com/connectors/shared_customerinsights/dynamics-365-customer-insights-connector/).

## Power Automate actions
The Power Automate connector provides other actions than the available triggers. For more information, see the [Dynamics 365 Customer Insights Connector](https://docs.microsoft.com/connectors/customerinsights/).

1. In Power Automate, select one of the available triggers to create your preferred flow. If you're creating your first flow, you'll need to authenticate with the Power Automate connector first.
