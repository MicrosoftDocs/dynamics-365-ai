# Export data from Dynamics 365 Customer Service Insights

[!INCLUDE[cc-beta-prelease-disclaimer.md](../includes/cc-beta-prerelease-disclaimer.md)]

Dynamics 365 Customer Service Insights enables you to export your data to a web API endpoint.

You can then query the API for additional insights that go beyond the [default dashboards](dashboard-overview.md). 

1. Go to **Settings**.

2. Select **Export data**. You see the Export data window where you choose the export method.

3. Select **Generate URL** to create a new web API endpoint for the exported data, which you can copy to the clipboard. 

**Delete URL** disables any previously generated URL. You can then generate a new URL. 


## Exported data fields 

The web API endpoint includes the following if they're available in your workspace. 

Fields that aren't applicable or are mapped incorrectly may not be listed in some workspaces.

## Considerations
* Before sharing the exported data with others, check that you and the people you're sharing with have the correct permissions. 

* The exported data is refreshed daily, following the typical workspace refresh schedule.  Exported data isn't refreshed if a workspace refresh is temporarily paused because of inactivity after 30 days.

* If you suspect the URL has been inappropriately shared, delete the URL and generate a new one. This action disables the old URL and prevents it from being used. 

* Rate limits for accessing the API for every IP address are: 
  * Five times per minute
  * 20 times per hour
  * 100 times per day

* Rate limits for accessing the API for every key as the parameter of that API are:
  * Five times per minute
  * 20 times per hour
  * 100 times per day
