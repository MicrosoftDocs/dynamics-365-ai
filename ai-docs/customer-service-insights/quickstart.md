# Quickstart - Get immediate insights into your customer service system's performance

Dynamics 365 Customer Service Insights lets you quickly connect to your existing Dynamics 365 customer service data to gain immediate insights into your system's performance. 

> [!NOTE]
> This standalone experience is moving into Dynamics 365 Customer Service where you can find the same capabilities deeply embedded in the customer service experiences. For more information, see [Customer Service Insights across your support organization](ci-insights-across-org.md). 

The following includes older documentation for the standalone application.  

## To connect to your customer service data

1. Navigate to [https://csi.ai.dynamics.com](https://csi.ai.dynamics.com) in your browser to open Customer Service Insights. Customer Service Insights supports Microsoft Edge, Internet Explorer 11, and Chrome browsers.

   On the **Connect your data** screen, select the data source for your customer service data.

2. On the **Get customer service data** screen, create a Customer Service Insights workspace by selecting the customer service environment you want to use.

   For more information on working with workspaces, see [Use and manage workspaces to connect to different customer service environments](use-workspaces.md).

   Customer Service Insights configures the workspace to use the environment you selected and displays the environment's customer service data in the KPI Summary dashboard.

You can gain a variety of insights from the Customer Service Insights dashboards. For example, AI Insights charts help you identify support cases that have the most impact on your system.

If you want to explore working with the dashboards using sample data before connecting to live data, use the Customer Service Insights built-in demo workspace. To open the demo workspace, select **demo workspace** on the **Connect your data** screen.

* [New cases dashboard](dashboard-incoming-cases.md)

Customer Service Insights also includes a Topics page, which uses artificial intelligence technology to group related support cases as topics and display them in order of the number of cases associated with each topic. For information on working with the Topics page, see [Manage and improve artificial intelligence grouping of support cases as topics](topics-page.md).
