# Map your data to custom entities and fields

Dynamics 365 Customer Service Insights works by default with data from Dynamics 365 Customer Service. The built-in dashboards and interactive charts in Customer Service Insights use data stored in default Dynamics 365 entities and data fields, primarily in the Case entity and several related entities in Common Data Service.

However, you might want to generate insights by mapping to data from custom entities and fields in Common Data Service. Mapping to data from custom entities and fields is useful in the following cases:

* You aren't a Dynamics 365 Customer Service customer.
* You are a Dynamics 365 Customer Service customer, but your service solution is customized and you use custom entities and fields to store support case data.
* You want to use a custom field other than the support case title in your Customer Service Insights dashboards.

When you create a Customer Service Insights workspace and connect to a Dynamics 365 environment, Customer Service Insights prompts you to map your data:

* If the environment doesn't have a Case entity.
* If the environment has a Case entity, but the entity doesn't contain enough required data.

After a workspace is created, you can map to data from custom entities and fields by specifying data mapping settings.

For more information, see [Dynamics 365 Customer Service entities used by Customer Service Insights](customer-service-entities.md) and [Use and manage workspaces to connect to different customer service environments](use-workspaces.md).

## To map data when you connect to a Dynamics 365 environment

1. Follow the steps in [Use and manage workspaces to connect to different customer service environments](use-workspaces.md) to connect to a Dynamics 365 environment.

2. If the environment doesn't have a Case entity, or if the environment has a Case entity but the entity doesn’t contain enough required data, Customer Service Insights displays the **Map your data** screen. Select **Get started** to begin mapping your data.

3. On the **Find your incident records** page, select any entities that contain the data fields you want to use for mapping, and then select **Next**.

4. On the **Map your incident records** page, select the data fields you want to use from the drop-down list. Some fields will have been mapped automatically. Then select **Done**.

## To map data by specifying data mapping settings

1. Select the **Settings** button on the Customer Service Insights title bar, and then select **Data mapping**.

   ![Select mapping](media/select-mapping.png)

   Customer Service Insights displays the **Data mapping** page, which shows the available destination entities.

2. To edit your mapping settings for an entity, hover over the entity in the list and then select the edit icon.

   ![Edit entity](media/edit-entity.png)

    Customer Service Insights displays the **Map your incident records** page, where you can update the data mapping for the entity.

3. You can view the status of the mapping in the **Mapped Fields** column.

Here are some things to keep in mind when you map your data to custom entities and fields:

* The drop-down list on the form only shows source fields in types that are compatible with the destination fields.

* Several data fields in the Case entity&mdash;including Priority, SupportChannel, SLAStatus, and Satisfaction&mdash;are picklists. A *picklist* is an attribute type in Common Data Service you can use to select multiple options. Each option consists of a numeric value and a string label.

  For example, SLAStatus indicates whether a case is compliant with the service-level agreement (SLA). You can define multiple different values for compliant cases; however, to identify non-compliant cases, Customer Service Insights only uses the value **4**. In another example, the picklist values defined for Satisfaction indicate customer satisfaction (CSAT) scores ranging from **1** to **5**. Customer Service Insights reads these values to calculate average CSAT.


* When you create a custom entity and field in Power Apps, a custom option value is auto-generated for each option label you add to a form. It's important you make sure the picklist's option values are aligned with data requirements. For example, an SLAStatus field should use the value **4** to indicate that a case is not compliant, and the values of a CSAT field should reflect the actual CSAT score (**1** to **5**, in most cases).
