## What's translated

Customer Service Insights will use your language preference to display elements like the menu, dashboard label text, and messages in your preferred language.

Because the dashboard is connected to your data, the following items remain in their original language:

- Your case titles
- Topics generated by AI based on the case titles
- Your environment name

## Choose your language settings  

The list of languages is shown in the product is based on the language preferences and regional settings obtained from your device and browser settings.

The way you access and change these preferences may vary depending on your operating system and browser.

## Language support for case grouping as topics

Customer Service Insights comes with natural language understanding models that can understand the text semantics and intent in the following languages:

* English
* French
* German
* Italian
* Japanese
* Portuguese
* Simplified Chinese
* Spanish

Each language model also has the capability to process English cases in addition to the other language it’s optimized for. For other languages that are not listed above, Customer Service Insights still tries to group the cases using natural language processing, but without the understanding of text semantics and intent. 

The language-specific models enable better language understanding capability for the corresponding languages. When Customer Service Insights refreshes your workspace and processes the case data, it will automatically detect the primary languages used in your cases. 

If more than 70% of the cases are in languages supported by a specific language model, that model will be used to discover topics from all of your cases; otherwise, a mixed-language model is used. 

For example, if you have more than 70% of cases detected in English, the English language model will be used to process all of your cases. If more than 70% of your cases are in Spanish, or most in Spanish with some English cases (since all language models have the capability to process English), the Spanish model will be used to process all of your cases.
