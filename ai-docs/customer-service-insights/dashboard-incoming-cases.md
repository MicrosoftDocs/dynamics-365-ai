# New cases dashboardâ€‹

![New cases dashboard](media/new-cases.png)

The New cases dashboard gives you an overview of the new cases in your customer service system. It uses artificial intelligence (AI) technology to help you identify popular and emerging issues.

The New cases dashboard includes a variety of charts with graphical views of your system's new support cases. For information about each chart, click the link for the chart in the following list or scroll to locate the chart later in this topic.

* [Case priority](#case-priority-chart)
* [Case channel](#case-channel-chart)
* [Case timing](#case-timing-chart)
* [Popular topics (AI Insights)](#popular-topics-chart)
* [Emerging topics (AI Insights)](#emerging-topics-chart)

The Popular topics and Emerging topics charts use natural language understanding to group support cases as *topics* that are a collection of related cases. These charts show you the new customer support topics that are generating the most case volume and the topics that are showing the biggest change in volume. This can help you identify emerging issues in your system.

By default, the dashboard shows you key performance indicators for the past month, and for all products, channels, business units, and teams in your system. To change the time period, select a value from the **Time period** drop-down list at the top of the dashboard. You can select either past day, past week, or past month.

To filter data by product, channel, business unit, or team, select a value from the **Product**, **Channel**, **Business Unit**, or **Team** drop-down list. If you switch to a different dashboard, the filter you specify persists and is applied to the data on all dashboards. For more information on working with filters, see [Work with Customer Service Insights dashboards](use-dashboard-sample-data.md).
