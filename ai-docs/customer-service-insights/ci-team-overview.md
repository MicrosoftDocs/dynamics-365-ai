# Analyze overall team's behavior on customer calls

[!INCLUDE [cc-beta-prerelease-disclaimer](../includes/cc-beta-prerelease-disclaimer.md)]

Customer Service calls are one of the most important part of your business, as these calls help you to change the shape of your business by improving customer satisfaction. The **Team overview** page in call insights helps supervisors analyze the overall behavior of their team during customer calls. This helps in identifying coaching scenarios for the team to increase customer satisfaction and activity gains for the business.

As a supervisor, these KPIs and insights help you to: 

- Assess overall customer sentiments and sentiment trends.
  
- Assess your team's contributions toward customer sentiment.

- Gain insight into what’s going on with your team.

- Analyze your team's conversational style.

To view the **Team overview** page, sign in to  **Call insights (Preview)**, then select **Team overview**.
