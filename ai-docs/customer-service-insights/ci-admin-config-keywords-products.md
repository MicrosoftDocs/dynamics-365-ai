# Configure keywords and products to track

You should configure keywords and products that are relevant to you and your organization so you can track them in calls. Whenever the defined keywords or products are mentioned in a call, conversation intelligence will gather the data and display it appropriately on the dashboard.

> [!NOTE]
> As a supervisor, you can define tracked keywords and products that are specific to your team. That is, you want to track these keywords and products only for your team member calls. 
> The changes you made apply only to your team and doesn't impact the administrator-defined settings for your organization.

Using the **Conversation content** section, you can add or remove keywords and products to track in the calls. To do this, follow these steps:

1.	Review the prerequisites. To learn more, see [Prerequisites to configure call insights(ci-admin-prereqs.md).

2.	Open the **Conversation Intelligence** application. 

3.	Select the **Settings** icon on the top-right of the page and then select **Settings**.

    > [!div class="mx-imgBorder"]
    > ![Select settings option](media/si-app-admin-select-settings.png "Select settings option")

4.	On the **Settings** page, select **Conversation content**.

    > [!div class="mx-imgBorder"]
    > ![Conversations section](media/si-app-admin-select-conversation-content.png "Conversations section")

5.	On the **Tracked keywords** section, enter a keyword in the **Add a keyword**, and press **Enter**.

    > [!div class="mx-imgBorder"]
    > ![Tracked keywords section](media/si-app-admin-enter-tracked-keywords.png "Tracked keywords section")

6.	Repeat **step 5** to add other keywords.

7.	In the **Products** section, enter a product's name in the **Add a product** field, and press **Enter**.
