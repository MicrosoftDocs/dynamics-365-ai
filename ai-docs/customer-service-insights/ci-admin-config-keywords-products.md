# Configure keywords and products to track

[!INCLUDE [cc-beta-prerelease-disclaimer](../includes/cc-beta-prerelease-disclaimer.md)]

You should configure keywords and products that are relevant to you and your organization so you can track them in calls. Whenever the defined keywords or products are mentioned in a call, call insights will gather the data and display it appropriately on the dashboard.

> [!NOTE]
> As a supervisor, you can define tracked keywords and products that are specific to your team. That is, you want to track these keywords and products only for your team member calls. 
> The changes you make apply only to your team and don't impact the administrator-defined settings for your organization.

Using the **Conversation content** section, you can add or remove keywords and products to track in the calls. To do this, follow these steps:

1.	Review the prerequisites. To learn more, see [Prerequisites to configure call insights](ci-admin-prereqs.md).

2.	Open **call insights** in Customer Service Insights. 

3.	Select the **Settings** icon on the top-right of the page and then select **Settings**.

    > [!div class="mx-imgBorder"]
    > ![Select settings option](media/ci-app-admin-select-settings.png "Select settings option")

4.	On the **Settings** page, select **Conversation content**.

    > [!div class="mx-imgBorder"]
    > ![Conversations section](media/ci-app-admin-select-conversation-content.png "Conversations section")

5.	On the **Tracked support keywords** section, enter a keyword in the **Add a keyword**, and press **Enter**.

    > [!div class="mx-imgBorder"]
    > ![Tracked keywords section](media/ci-app-admin-enter-tracked-keywords.png "Tracked keywords section")

6.	Repeat **step 5** to add other keywords.

7.	In the **Products** section, enter a product's name in the **Add a product** field, and press **Enter**.

    > [!div class="mx-imgBorder"]
    > ![Products section](media/ci-app-admin-enter-products.png "Products section")

8.	Repeat **step 7** to add other product names.

9.	Select **Save**.
