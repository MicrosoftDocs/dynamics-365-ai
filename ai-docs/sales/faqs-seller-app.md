# Frequently asked questions for seller capabilities

## Relationship analytics

**What do I need in order to use Relationship analytics?​**<br>
Relationship analytics uses data from Dynamics 365 for Sales. Optionally, it includes data from Exchange Online and LinkedIn InMail with the LinkedIn solution with sync-back enabled. For Exchange data, the graph is built only on user accounts situated in the United States.​

**How do I enable Relationship analytics?​**<br>
Install [!INCLUDE[pn_dynamics_sales_insights](../includes/pn-dynamics-sales-insights.md)] and enable the Relationship analytics feature from  **Settings** > **AI setup**.​

**What is the frequency of KPI updates?​**<br>
KPIs are updated every 24 hours, potentially fewer.​

**What are the signals in relationship health?​**<br>
Relationship health looks at activity, recency, engagement, and sentiment of activities between sellers and customers.​

**Can I configure relationship health?​**<br>
An administrator can influence the relationship health score by changing the weight of activity types and the expected level of communications with customers.

## Predictive lead/opportunity scoring

**What do I need in order to use lead/opportunity scoring?​**<br>
Install [!INCLUDE[pn_dynamics_sales_insights](../includes/pn-dynamics-sales-insights.md)] and use standard lead entity or standard opportunity entity.​

To build a lead score model, a minimum of 100 qualified and 1,000 disqualified leads are required. 

To build an opportunity scoring model, a minimum of 40 won and 40 lost opportunities are required. 

**Can I customize the model?​**<br>
You cannot customize the model. The out-of-the-box model automatically selects the features for the model.

**Can I create multiple models for leads/opportunities?​**<br>
No. In this release, you cannot create multiple models. You can create only one model for all leads and one model for all opportunities.

**What is the minimum data required to create a lead/opportunity score model?​**<br>
A minimum of 100 qualified and 1,000 disqualified leads are required to build a lead score model. 

A minimum of 40 won and 40 lost opportunities are required to build an opportunity scoring model.​

**What is the difference between score and grade?​**<br>
The score is generated by the machine learning model. <br>
The grade is just grouping scores in four buckets that the admin can configure.

## Notes analysis

**What do I need in order to use Notes analysis?​**<br>
Notes analysis requires Office 365.​

**How do I enable Notes analysis?​**<br>
Install [!INCLUDE[pn_dynamics_sales_insights](../includes/pn-dynamics-sales-insights.md)] and enable the Notes analysis feature from **Settings** > **AI setup**.​

**What does Notes analysis look at for the intent?​**<br>
Notes analysis looks at notes and posts on the timeline for the intent that may indicate a record should be created. Notes analysis looks for meeting requests, meetings, tasks, and contacts.

## Talking points

**What do I need in order to use Talking points?​**<br>
Talking points require Office 365 Exchange and a configured server-side sync (SSS) profile (mailbox need not be enabled for SSS).​

**How do I enable Talking points?​**<br>
Install [!INCLUDE[pn_dynamics_sales_insights](../includes/pn-dynamics-sales-insights.md)] and enable the Talking points feature from **Settings** > **AI setup**.​

**What do Talking points look at for the conversation starters?​**<br>
Talking points look at the inbox of the signed-in user for emails from the contact list that includes conversational topics relating to sports, entertainment, and health.​

**How is my privacy protected?​**<br>
User privacy is safeguarded because only emails from the signed-in user’s mailbox are shown. A colleague won't be able to see those same talking points unless they were also a recipient of that email.​

**How long will it take for results to appear?​**<br>
It takes a few seconds to display the results.​

## Who knows whom

**What do I need in order to use Who knows whom?​**<br>
Who knows whom requires Office 365 Exchange. The graph is built only on user accounts situated in the United States. Geo availability will expand as Sales Insights becomes available in more regions. Server-side sync is required for email introduction requests. ​

**How do I enable Who knows whom?​**<br>
Install [!INCLUDE[pn_dynamics_sales_insights](../includes/pn-dynamics-sales-insights.md)], opt in to Connection insights from the Office 365 admin, and enable the Who knows whom feature from **Settings** > **AI setup**.​

**How long will it take for results to appear?**<br>
The graph requires approximately 24 hours to populate the results for the first time. Subsequent updates take 3-6 days based on new activities included in the graph.​

**​Who will be included in the graph?​**<br>
Everyone in the tenant (in the United States until geo availability expands) will be included in the graph. Administrators have the option to opt out users or DLs, such as C-suite, M&A, finance, and so on. Per user, the self-serve opt-out will be available in the next few months.​

**​How are the connections weighted?**<br>
Connections are weighted by a combination of how well the signed-in user knows the intermediary, and how well the intermediary knows the target contact/lead. Consequently, this means a salesperson might not see the same results as another salesperson because they know different people in the organization.
