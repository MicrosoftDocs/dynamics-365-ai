# Manage Segments

A segment is a group of records, that are grouped together based on certain conditions, such as location, deal value, language, and product. Using segments, records can be automatically connected to sequences.

As a sequence manager, you can use the segment designer to:
- [Create and activate a segment](create-and-activate-a-segment.md)  
- [Connect a segment to sequence](connect-a-segment-to-sequence.md)
- [Edit a segment](edit-a-segment.md)
- [Delete or deactivate a segment](delete-deactivate-a-segment.md)

## Review prerequisites  

Before you start, be sure you've met the following prerequisites:
-	You must have the sequence manager, sales manager, or administrator role. More information: [Assign a security role to a user](https://docs.microsoft.com/power-platform/admin/create-users-assign-online-security-roles#assign-a-security-role-to-a-user).
-	The sales accelerator has been configured in your organization. More information: [Configure the sales accelerator](enable-configure-sales-accelerator.md).
