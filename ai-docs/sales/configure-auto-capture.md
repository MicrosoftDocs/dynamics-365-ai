# Enable and configure auto capture

When you enable auto capture, you help salespeople in your organization by suggesting relevant customer activities in Microsoft Dynamics 365 Sales by capturing emails and meetings from Outlook.

Auto capture is available in two forms:

-	**Auto capture** (also called _basic auto capture_): This feature is available for free with Dynamics 365 Sales Insights for Dynamics 365 Sales. To learn more, see [How to enable auto capture](#how-to-enable-basic-auto-capture).

-	**Premium auto capture**: Premium auto capture is available as a preview with Dynamics 365 Sales Insights for Dynamics 365 Sales. To learn more, see [How to enable and configure premium auto capture](#how-to-enable-and-configure-premium-auto-capture).

> [!IMPORTANT]
> By enabling this feature, you consent to share data about your customers' email activity with an external system. Data imported from external systems into Sales Insights are subject to the [Microsoft Privacy Statement](https://go.microsoft.com/fwlink/?linkid=2116778).
