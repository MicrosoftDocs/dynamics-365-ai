When you open the Dynamics 365 assistant app in Teams on your mobile device, you’ll see the home page. This home page provides high-level information on the meetings and insight cards that are specific to you. Typically, the home page displays the following:

2.	[Highlighted insights](#highlighted-insights)
3.	[Settings](#settings)

## Highlighted meetings

Meetings for the current day are displayed along with participants, regarding, and related entities. To learn more, see [Working with meetings](working-with-meetings-teams.md).

## Highlighted insights

The highlighted insights section displays the insight cards that are most important and with relevant information about what you must do next. You can perform the defined actions on the cards such as open, send email, snooze, or dismiss. You can open the card to see the details and what the card is about. To learn more, see [Use assistant to guide customer communications](assistant.md).

## Settings

The settings option allows you to change your organization, send feedback, and get information about the app version.

The organization option helps you to change the organization and view the information regarding the selected organization. To learn more, see [Change sales organization](change-sales-organization.md).

To send feedback, select **Share feedback**. A pop-up appears at the bottom of the screen with these options: **Tell us what you like** and **Tell us how we can get better**. Select the appropriate feedback option. On the feedback form, enter the information that you want to share with us and your email. Sharing your email ID is optional; if you share, it helps us to gather more information on the feedback that you have shared and communicate with you about the status. After you enter the necessary information, select **Send**. 

Here is an example of a **Tell us what you like** feedback form.
