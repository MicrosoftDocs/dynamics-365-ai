The Dynamics 365 assistant app for Microsoft Teams provides information about your daily meetings on your mobile device. This helps you to prepare for an upcoming meeting so that you can build a strong relationship with customers. These meetings display the list of participants who are external and not in your organization. The app displays meetings related to your current day and keeps you up to date by syncing in real time with your Microsoft 365 account. 

The meetings provide basic information such as subject, time and location, participants, regarding entities, and related entities.

> ![Meeting preparation page](media/si-teams-app-meeting-preparations.png "Meeting preparation page") 

To view more details, select and open the meeting. The **Meeting preparation** page opens with detailed information. 

> [!div class="mx-imgBorder"]
> ![Meeting page with more details](media/si-teams-app-meeting-preparations-more-details.png "Meeting page with more details")  

The meeting preparation page is typically divided into the following sections:

1.	[Meeting information](#meeting-information) 

2.	[Participants](#participants)

3.	[Regarding entity](#regarding-entity)

4.	[Activity timeline and insight cards](#activities-timeline-and-insight-cards)

## Meeting information

The meeting preparation section provides information on the subject, when the meeting is scheduled, and where the meeting is happening. This information is view-only. You cannot edit it in the app. 

## Participants

Participants are the customers and the organizer who are attending the meeting. You can see who will attend with the acceptance status such as accepted, tentative, and declined. 

### Add new customer contact

If any customers in the participant list are not in your contacts, you can add them to the contact list in the Dynamics 365 Sales organization. These contacts are displayed under the **NEW CONTACT** section. 


Select the contact and the contact opens. At the bottom of the customer details page, select **Add to Dynamics 365**. The customer is added to the contact list in the Dynamics 365 Sales organization.

### View details of a customer

To view more details about a customer, select the contact. The following details are displayed:

-	Contact information for the customer such as mobile number and business email.

-	Colleagues in your organization who know and can introduce you to this contact. To learn more, see [How to get introduced to a lead](who-knows-whom.md).

-	Talking points to start a conversation with the added customer. To learn more, see [Know conversation starters for your customers](talking-points.md).

## Regarding entity

The regarding entity specifies what the meeting is about, such as opportunity, lead, contact, or account. When a meeting is attached to an entity, the meeting displays the timeline, insight, participant information, and corresponding related entities. Also, the regarding entity helps you to understand what the meeting is about, so you can come prepared with relevant information.

In the following image, you can see that the meeting is regarding an opportunity that has 10 orders of product... .

### Add regarding entity

You can add a regarding entity to a meeting when no regarding entity is attached to it. When you add the regarding entity, its corresponding related entities are also added to the meeting.

To add a regarding entity, follow these steps:

2.	On the **Set regarding** page, select a regarding field from the list of entities.

    > [!div class="mx-imgBorder"]
    > ![Add regarding entity through set regarding option](media/si-teams-app-search-regarding-entity.png "Add regarding entity through set regarding option")
 
    The regarding entity is added to the meeting along with its corresponding related entities.

### Update regarding entity

You can update the regarding entity when it no longer is relevant or there are changes to the meeting. To update the regarding entity, follow these steps:

1.	Select and open the meeting. The **Meeting preparation** page opens with detailed information.

2.	From the **REGARDING** section, select more options (**…**) and then select **Change regarding record**.

## Activities timeline and insight cards

See a combined view of your interactions with customers across various channels, such as phone, email, or even social activities in the timeline that are related to the regarding entity. The timeline also shows any related notes or system posts. Also, cards are displayed below the timeline based on the related entities.

The timeline activities and cards are retrieved from your Dynamics 365 Sales organization for the selected regarding entity.

The following image is an example of an activity timeline for an opportunity regarding entity.
