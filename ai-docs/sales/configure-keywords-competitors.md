# Configure keywords and competitors to track

You should configure keywords and competitors that are relevant to you and your organization so you can track them in calls. Whenever the defined keywords or competitors are mentioned in a call, conversation intelligence will gather the data and display it appropriately on the dashboard.

> [!NOTE]
> As a sales manager, you can define tracked keywords and competitors that are specific to your team. That is, you want to track these keywords and competitors only for your team member calls. 
> The changes you made apply only to your team and doesn't impact the administrator-defined settings for your organization.

Using the **Conversation content** section, you can add or remove keywords and competitors to track in the calls. To do this, follow these steps:
