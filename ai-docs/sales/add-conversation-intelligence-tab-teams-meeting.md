The Dynamics 365 Sales app on Microsoft Teams allows you to enrich your remote selling experience by conducting valuable and meaningful customer conversations&mdash;which translate into revenue, by adding conversation intelligence as an integral part of any Teams meeting.    

As a seller, you don’t need to move between apps to take notes and action items, which takes your attention off the business. Use the app during a Teams meeting to get a real-time transcript with highlighted points of interest and captured action items. Additionally, you can take notes, when necessary. 

**Prerequisites**

Before you start using the Dynamics 365 Sales app, be sure you've met the following prerequisites:   
- Conversation intelligence is enabled in your organization. More information: [Microsoft Teams for conversation intelligence](fre-setup-sales-insight-app.md#microsoft-teams-for-conversation-intelligence).
- Purchase a Sales Insights license or Dynamics 365 Sales Premium license.

**To add the conversation intelligence tab**

1.	On Microsoft Teams, go to **Calendar**.     
2.	Open the meeting and select **+** (add tab).
