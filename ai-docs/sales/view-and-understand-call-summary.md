# View and understand call summary  

Sellers and their managers need an easy way to review their conversations with their customers and quickly find relevant talking points, keywords, and insights.  
The call summary page provides a high-level view of how the call went, and includes signals (such as identified action items and relevant keywords mentioned), the call timeline, a transcript, and more.  
The information on the call summary page helps:  
- Sellers quickly ramp up on past conversations with customers and highlight important topics and commitments.  
- Managers get a high-level view of how their team is managing their relationships with customers.  
The call summary is available in both conversation intelligence and Sales Hub apps.
