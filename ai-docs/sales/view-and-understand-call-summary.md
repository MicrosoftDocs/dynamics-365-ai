# View and understand call summary page

Sellers and their managers need an easy way to review the conversations they've had with their customers and quickly find relevant talking points, keywords, and insights.  
The call summary page provides a high-level view of how the conversation with a customer went, and includes action items and relevant keywords, a timeline, a transcript of the call, and more.  

The information on the call summary page helps both sellers and managers:

- Sellers can quickly ramp up on past conversations with customers, and highlight important topics and commitments.
- Managers can get a high-level view of how their team is managing their relationships with customers.  

Call summaries are available from the conversation intelligence capabilities of the Sales Insights Add-in for Dynamics 365 Sales and in the Sales Hub app.

## Prerequisites

- Configure conversation intelligence to process call recordings. More information: [Administer conversation intelligence](intro-admin-guide-sales-insights.md#administer-conversation-intelligence)
- [Configure conversation intelligence to connect call data](configure-conversation-intelligence-call-data.md) so you can process call recordings.
- To display the **Call Insights** tab in Sales Hub, ensure that [the latest version of Sales Insights](https://appsource.microsoft.com/product/dynamics-365/mscrm.70b76f06-f739-4808-bd58-b5674a0a42d4?tab=Overview) is installed in your organization.
- [Include and update the *CallPhoneCallCrmId* parameter](configure-conversation-intelligence-call-data.md#upload-call-recordings) with your Dynamics 365 organization's GUID to the metadata file while uploading the call recordings for processing. This helps to connect the call with the activity inside Dynamics 365.

### Call playback timeline and segmentation

Using the call playback feature, you can listen to the entire recorded call or choose a point on the timeline&mdash;by dragging the progress bar or selecting the specific point&mdash;at which you want to start listening. The call transcript will automatically scroll to that moment in the call. You can also pause, rewind, and move forward through the call, and adjust volume as you like. The playback timeline also displays the sentiments detected in the conversation (positive, neutral, or negative).    
When you go to the **Highlights** tab and select a keyword or other highlight, a diamond icon appears on the playback timeline to indicate the time that the selected highlight was mentioned. Also, hovering over a keyword displays gray diamond icons on the timeline.   
On the timeline, you can see how the conversation was segmented. The topics (if any) that were discussed in a segment are identified. To better drill down into the conversation, you can choose a specific segment and see the insights that are relevant to it. Some examples of segments are introduction, solution, price quote, and call close. The transcript is adjusted to display the start of the segment, and the playback timeline is highlighted for the selected segment. If the selected segment contains any action items or keywords, they're displayed on their respective tabs.
