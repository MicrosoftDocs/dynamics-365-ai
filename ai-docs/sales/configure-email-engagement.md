# Configure email engagement

Email engagement helps users in your organization receive alerts and reminders that help build customer relationships.

> [!NOTE]
> To benefit from the complete experience of email engagement, turn on the email engagement insight cards **[Email opened](action-cards-reference.md#EmailOpened)** and **[Email reminder](action-cards-reference.md#EmailReminder)**.

> [!IMPORTANT]
> By enabling this feature, you consent to share data about your customers' email activity with other Microsoft services. Data imported from external systems into Dynamics 365 Sales Insights is subject to our privacy statement.

## Prerequisites

Verify the following prerequisites before enabling email engagement for your organization:

- Enable standard Sales Insights features. More information: [Enable and configure standard Sales Insights features](intro-admin-guide-sales-insights.md#enable-and-configure-standard-sales-insights-features)

- To use followed email attachments:

    - [!INCLUDE[pn_onedrive_for_business](../includes/pn-onedrive-for-business.md)] must be available to your Dynamics 365 Sales server. More information: [Enable OneDrive for Business](/dynamics365/customer-engagement/admin/enable-onedrive-for-business) 

    - Enable document management for email in Sales. More information:[Enable SharePoint document management for specific entities](/dynamics365/customer-engagement/admin/enable-sharepoint-document-management-specific-entities) 

    - Enable SharePoint to be shared externally to anonymous (unauthenticated) users to allow external email recipients to access file attachments. More information: [External sharing overview](/sharepoint/external-sharing-overview)

- To enable delivery-time recommendations based on recipients' time zones, you must enable [!INCLUDE[pn_bing_maps](../includes/pn-bing-maps.md)] in Sales. More information: [System Settings dialog box - General tab](/dynamics365/customer-engagement/admin/system-settings-dialog-box-general-tab)

## Enable email engagement
