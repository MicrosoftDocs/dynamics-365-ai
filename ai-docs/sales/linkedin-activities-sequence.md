# Add LinkedIn activities to sequence

In sequences, activities that are based on LinkedIn Sales Navigator allow sellers to diversify their day-to-day activities by including the social selling functions that are available in LinkedIn. You can use LinkedIn's vast network with recommended actions that your sellers can take to build deeper connections.

As an administrator or sequence manager, you can add the following activities to sequences:   
-	[Research](#research-activity)
-	[Get introduced](#get-introduced-activity) 
-	[Connect](#connect-activity)
-	[Send InMail](#send-inmail)

## Prerequisites  

Ensure that you meet the following requirements before configuring the LinkedIn activities:   
-	Verify that LinkedIn Sales Navigator is configured in your organization. More information: [Install and enable LinkedIn Sales Navigator](/dynamics365/linkedin/install-sales-navigator).
-	Verify that the latest solution with version **3.0.1.1060** for **msdyn_LinkedInSalesNavigatorAnchor** is installed. 
    - Go to **Advanced settings** > **Solutions** and search for **msdyn_LinkedInSalesNavigatorAnchor**. The version number should be 3.0.1.1060 or later. 
-	You have proper license to use LinkedIn Sales Navigator. More information: [Microsoft Relationship Sales](https://dynamics.microsoft.com/en-in/sales/relationship-sales/).

## Research activity

The **Research** activity allows sellers to view the LinkedIn profile, including the customer’s contact and account information.

When the activity is displayed to the seller, the LinkedIn research step is displayed in the **Up next** widget and work list.
