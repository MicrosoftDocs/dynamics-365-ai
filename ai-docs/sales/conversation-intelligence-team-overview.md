# Analyze overall team's behavior on customer calls

Sales calls are one of the most important part of your business as these calls help you to change the shape of your business by improving sales and generating revenue. The **Teams overview** page helps the sales managers analyze the overall behavior of their team during customer calls. This helps in identifying coaching scenarios for the team to increase sales wins and productivity gains for the business.

As a sales manager, these KPIs and insights help you to: 

- Assess overall customer sentiments and sentiment trends.
  
- Assess your team's contributions toward customer sentiment.

- Gain insight into what’s going on with your team.

- Analyze your team's conversational style.

To view the **Teams overview** page, sign in to  **Dynamics 365 Sales Insights** application, and select **Teams overview**.
