# Premium auto capture

> - Microsoft doesn't provide support for this preview feature. Microsoft Technical Support wonâ€™t be able to help you with issues or questions. Preview features aren't meant for production use and are subject to a separate [supplemental terms of use](/dynamics365/legal/supp-dynamics365-preview).

Premium auto capture helps salespeople focus on generating revenue instead of spending their time updating Dynamics 365 Sales data and logging every customer-related activity. In addition to activity suggestions based on capturing emails and meetings, premium auto capture also provides suggestions for creating new contacts.

> [!NOTE]
> To view the **Activity suggestions** and **Contact suggestions** options on the **Sales** site map, the security role assigned to you must have read privileges on **Suggested Activity** and **Suggested Contact** entities. To learn more, see [Security roles and privileges](/power-platform/admin/security-roles-privileges). <br>
> By default, administrators can view these options on the **Sales** site map. However, you must enable premium auto capture feature in your organization to use it. To learn more, see [How to enable and configure premium auto capture](configure-auto-capture.md#how-to-enable-and-configure-premium-auto-capture)

## Give consent

When an administrator enables premium auto capture, you need to give your consent to allow Dynamics 365 Sales to access your Exchange data so that auto capture can provide suggestions for activities and contacts. You can give consent in one of the following ways:

-	[Timeline](#through-the-timeline)

-	[Personal settings](#through-personal-settings)

### Through the timeline

1.	Sign in to the Dynamics 365 Sales Hub app.

2.	On the site map, select an entity&mdash;for example, **Opportunities**.

3.	Select a record from the list.

4.	On the timeline, select **Allow access**.

    > [!div class="mx-imgBorder"]
    > ![Provide consent on the timeline](media/auto-capture-timeline-provide-consent.png "Give consent on the timeline") 

### Through personal settings

1.	Sign in to the Dynamics 365 Sales Hub app.

2.	At the bottom of the site map, select **Change area**, and then select **Personal settings** > **Insights** > **Productivity** > **Auto capture**.

4.	Turn on the **Allow access** toggle. 

    > [!div class="mx-imgBorder"]
    > ![Provide consent through personal settings](media/auto-capture-premium-consent-personal-settings.png "Give consent through personal settings") 

    > [!NOTE]
    > You can turn off the **Allow access** toggle if you don't want Dynamics 365 to access your Outlook data to get activity and contact suggestions. 


## Manage activity suggestions on the timeline

When you open the record for an entity, the timeline displays the activity suggestions, such as emails and meetings, that are available for the record. Based on the communication captured from your Exchange data, these suggestions will be visible only to you. The suggestions are available for you to review and save for other users to view. You can also dismiss or edit the suggestions, to make sure you capture the right information in the right place. 

> [!div class="mx-imgBorder"]
> ![Auto capture suggestions](media/auto-capture-premium-activity-suggestions.png "Auto capture suggestions")

By default, a single suggestion is displayed. You can select **Show more** to display up to three suggestions at a time. If you've got more than three suggestions, the **Show all** option is displayed. Select **Show all** to view the list of all available suggestions.

> [!div class="mx-imgBorder"]
> ![Auto capture all activity suggestions](media/auto-capture-premium-all-activity-suggestions.png "Auto capture all activity suggestions")

-	**Sync and connect**: Select the check mark icon to add a suggestion as an activity on the timeline wall of a record. After the suggestion is added, other users in your organization can view this suggestion for the record. For example, you open an opportunity **Interest shown in AX27** and observe that there are a few suggestions available under it on the timeline. With the **Kenny Smith sent an email** suggestion selected, select the **Sync and connect** icon. The suggestion is saved as an **Kenny Smith sent an email** activity on the timeline, and will be visible for other users who access this opportunity.

    > [!div class="mx-imgBorder"]
    > ![Save activity suggestion on timeline](media/auto-capture-premium-save-activity-suggestion-timeline.png "Saved activity suggestion on the timeline") 

-	**Edit**: Select the pencil icon to add a suggestion as an activity for another record. When you edit and sync the suggestion, it's available as an activity on the timeline of the other record and will be visible for users who have access to the record. For example, you open an email from **Kenny Smith**. On the timeline, you observe that the **Kenny Smith sent an email** suggestion is more appropriate for **Jim Glynn** than the suggestion. Select the edit option, and then use the **Regarding** lookup to choose **Jim Glynn**. 
 
    > [!div class="mx-imgBorder"]
    > ![Edit activity suggestion on timeline](media/auto-capture-premium-edit-activity-suggestion-timeline.png "Edit an activity suggestion on the timeline") 

    After you save the change, a confirmation message appears and specifies that the activity has been added to the **Jim Glynn** email.

-	**Remove**: Select this option if you don't want to add a suggestion as an activity on the timeline. For example, you opened an opportunity **Interest shown in AX27**. On the timeline, you observe that the **Kenny Smith sent an email** suggestion isn't appropriate for the **Regarding** fields that it's associated with, and you want to ignore it. Select the remove option, and then select **OK** in the confirmation message that appears. The suggestion will no longer appear in the list.

## Manage activity suggestions through the grid

The activity suggestions grid provides a single view for all the captured activities based on your communications. This ensures the information isn't lost on the timeline and helps you track activity suggestions in one place. The activity list consists of emails and meetings that are fetched and captured from your Outlook data by premium auto capture.

> [!div class="mx-imgBorder"]
> ![Activity suggestion grid view](media/auto-capture-premium-activity-suggestion-grid-view.png "Activity suggestion grid view")

The Activity suggestions grid consists of the following columns:

-	**Activity**: This column specifies the type of activity, such as email or meeting. 

-	**Sender**: This column specifies the name from whom the activity was received.

-	**Subject**: This column specifies the subject line of the activity.

-	**Regarding Entity**: This column specifies the entity to which the activity could be added.

-	**Regarding**: This column specifies the record to which the activity can be added.
