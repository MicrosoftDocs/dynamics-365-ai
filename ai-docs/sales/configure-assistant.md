# Configure the assistant

The assistant in Dynamics 365 Sales (formerly known as Relationship assistant) helps sellers track their daily actions and communications through a collection of actionable insight cards. 

The assistant is available in two forms:

- **Assistant (standard)**: This feature is included with Dynamics 365 Sales Enterprise. The assistant comes with a set of out-of-the-box standard cards. As an administrator, you can configure which insight cards to present to users to help then stay on top of their day. Some insight cards are enabled by default, as an administrator, you can enable, disable or customize the standard cards. To configure the assistant (standard), see [Configure and manage insight cards for the standard assistant](#configure-and-manage-insight-cards-for-the-standard-assistant).

- **Assistant (premium)**: The premium assistant is available in Dynamics 365 Sales with the Dynamics 365 Sales Insights license. With premium assistant capabilities, you can leverage Power Automate directly from the assistant studio to create custom insight cards, tailored to the specific needs of your team. To configure the premium Assistant, see [Configure and manage insight cards for the premium assistant](#configure-and-manage-insight-cards-for-the-premium-assistant).

## Configure and manage insight cards for the standard assistant

### Prerequisites

Assign user privileges to give access to the Assistant features. The privileges required to access Sales Insights features are automatically enabled for all out-of-the-box security roles, but they're initially disabled for all custom roles. If you enable any Sales Insights features, you must check the settings listed in the following table to help ensure that your users can access those features, and to help ensure that other features don't stop working because of privilege cascades related to these features.

|Privilege| Security role tab |Description and requirements|
|--|--|--|
|**Action card**| **Core records**  |Gives the ability to view and interact with insight cards that are generated by Assistant. <br> **Warning:** If Assistant is enabled, all users *must* have a role with read access for this privilege. Because of cascading, users without this privilege will lose access to many Dynamics 365 Sales features when assistant is enabled.|
| **Action card user settings** | **Core records**  | Gives the ability to view and change user preferences for insight cards that are generated by Assistant. **Warning:** If Assistant is enabled, all users *must* have a role with read access for this privilege. Because of cascading, users without this privilege will lose access to many Dynamics 365 Sales features when Assistant is enabled. |

To learn more, see [Security roles and privileges](/dynamics365/customer-engagement/admin/security-roles-privileges).

### Configure and manage standard insight cards

1. On the sitemap, select **Insight cards** under **Assistant** to go to the **Manage insight cards** page.

    > [!TIP]
    > Alternatively, on the **Sales Insights settings** page, select **Manage** from the **Assistant (free)** section to go to the **Manage insight cards** page.

    The list of available cards is displayed. For details about each available insight card, including details about the configuration settings available for each and other details, see [Insight cards reference](action-cards-reference.md).

    > ![List of insight cards](media/si-admin-assistant-card-list.png "List of insight cards")
    
2.	To turn on the insight cards, select the cards that are grayed out and select **Turn on cards**.

    In this example, we have selected the cards **Recent Meetings (Exchange)** and **Email Opened**.

    In this example, we have selected the cards **SuggestedContacts** and **Upcoming Flight**.

    > [!div class="mx-imgBorder"]
    > ![Select cards to turn off or disable](media/si-admin-assistant-turn-off-cards.png "Select cards to turn off or disable")
    
4. To view more details of the cards such as preview of the cards, last modified time, turn on or off the card, and description, select the card.

    > [!TIP]
    > Alternatively, select the **More options** corresponding to the card and then select **Edit**. 

    > [!div class="mx-imgBorder"]

    Sellers can also set their own personal preferences for their insight cards. They can't add cards that you disable here, but they can disable cards that you have enabled if they don't find them useful. They can also change the configuration settings for those cards that have them, though your settings will be the defaults. To learn more, see [Manage insight cards](assistant.md#manage-insight-cards).
