# Configure the assistant
<!--note from editor: Please consider deleting the sections where I've noted the content is redundant. The problem with restating things is not only that they're expensive to localize, they're confusing to the reader. I had to stop and back up several times to verify whether the information had been covered already or was I seeing something new; duplicating it means we're introducing "a difference that makes no difference."-->
The assistant in Dynamics 365 Sales (formerly known as relationship assistant) helps sellers track their daily actions and communications through a collection of actionable insight cards. 

The assistant is available in two forms:

- **Assistant (standard)**: This feature is included with Dynamics 365 Sales Enterprise. The assistant comes with a set of out-of-the-box standard cards. As an administrator, you can configure which insight cards to present to users to help them stay on top of their day. Some insight cards are enabled by default; you can enable, disable, or customize the standard cards. To configure the standard assistant, see [Configure and manage insight cards for the standard assistant](#configure-and-manage-insight-cards-for-the-standard-assistant).

- **Assistant (premium)**: The premium assistant is available in Sales with the Dynamics 365 Sales Insights license. With premium assistant capabilities, you can use Power Automate directly from the assistant studio to create custom insight cards, tailored to the specific needs of your team. To configure the premium assistant, see [Configure and manage insight cards for the premium assistant](#configure-and-manage-insight-cards-for-the-premium-assistant).

## Configure and manage insight cards for the standard assistant

### Prerequisites

Assign user privileges to give access to the assistant features. The privileges required to access Sales Insights features are automatically enabled for all out-of-the-box security roles, but they're initially disabled for all custom roles. If you enable any Sales Insights features, you must check the settings listed in the following table to help ensure that your users can access those features, and to help ensure that other features don't stop working because of privilege cascades related to these features.

|Privilege| Security role tab |Description and requirements|
|--|--|--|
|**Action card**| **Core records**  |Gives the ability to view and interact with insight cards that are generated by the assistant. <br> **Warning:** If the assistant is enabled, all users *must* have a role with read access for this privilege. Because of cascading, users without this privilege will lose access to many Dynamics 365 Sales features when the assistant is enabled.|
| **Action card user settings** | **Core records**  | Gives the ability to view and change user preferences for insight cards that are generated by the assistant. **Warning:** If the assistant is enabled, all users *must* have a role with read access for this privilege. Because of cascading, users without this privilege will lose access to many Dynamics 365 Sales features when the assistant is enabled. |

### Configure and manage standard insight cards

1. On the site map under **Assistant**, select **Insight cards**.<!--note from editor: In a procedure, you don't have to describe what happens as a result of the steps you're telling the reader to take. It's best to remain crisp and directive, not so descriptive. That makes for less work and cost for you and for Loc.-->

    > [!TIP]
    > Alternatively, on the **Sales Insights settings** page, select **Manage** from the **Assistant (free)** section.<!--note from editor: Recommend deleting this tip. You don't need to describe two ways to do the same thing in a procedure. Readers want to get something done, they don't want to know all the different paths they might take. You'll not only keep from distracting the reader, you'll save work for yourself and Loc.-->

    The list of available cards is displayed.<!--Recommend deleting; this is another description of what the reader is already looking at.--> For details about each available insight card, including details about the configuration settings available for each and other details, see [Insight cards reference](action-cards-reference.md).<!--Procedures also aren't the right place to interrupt the steps you're guiding the reader through to stop and say "here's more information about that." They make more sense in the procedure introduction or in the "See also" block at the end.-->

    > [!div class="mx-imgBorder"]
    > ![List of insight cards](media/si-admin-assistant-card-list.png "List of insight cards")
    
2.	To turn on (enable) the insight cards, select the cards that are grayed out, and then select **Turn on cards**.

    In this example, we've selected the cards **Recent Meetings (Exchange)** and **Email Opened**.

    > [!div class="mx-imgBorder"]
    > ![Select cards to turn on](media/si-admin-assistant-turn-on-cards.png "Select cards to turn on")
    
    More information: [Manage insight cards](assistant.md#manage-insight-cards)

3. To turn off (disable) the insight cards, select the cards that have been turned on, and then select **Turn off cards**.
    
    In this example, we've selected the cards **SuggestedContacts**<!--It's unfortunate that the UI is missing a space here. Can you ask someone on the UI team to fix this?--> and **Upcoming Flight**.

    > [!div class="mx-imgBorder"]
    > ![Select cards to turn off](media/si-admin-assistant-turn-off-cards.png "Select cards to turn off")
    
4. To see a preview of a card, get more details about it&mdash;such as a description and the time it was last modified&mdash;or turn it on or off, select the card.<!--Edit okay? I didn't understand the original.-->

    > [!TIP]
    > Alternatively, you can select **More options** (...)<!--Edit okay? I presume this command is accessed through the ellipsis, but the screenshot doesn't actually show it.--> corresponding to the card, and then select **Edit**.<!--But... recommend deleting this tip.-->

    > [!div class="mx-imgBorder"]
    > ![View card details](media/si-admin-assistant-view-card-details.png "View card details")

    Sellers can also set their own personal preferences for their insight cards. They can't add cards that you disable here, but they can disable cards that you've enabled if they don't find them useful. They can also change the configuration settings for those cards that have them, though your settings will be the defaults. More information: [Manage insight cards](assistant.md#manage-insight-cards)

## Configure and manage insight cards for the premium assistant

The premium assistant that's part of the Sales Insights add-on offers advanced capabilities, including:<!--Deletion suggested; it's entirely covered in the list below.-->

1. Verify that you have [installed and configured premium Sales Insights features](intro-admin-guide-sales-insights.md#install-and-configure-premium-sales-insights-features).

2. Go to **Change area** in the lower-left corner of the page, and select **Sales Insights settings**.

3. On the site map under **Assistant**, select **Home**.

    > [!TIP]
    > Alternatively, on the **Sales Insights settings** page, select **Manage** from the **Assistant (full capabilities)** section.<!--As above: recommend deleting.-->

4. On the **Home** tab (**Assistant Studio** page), you can:<!--You don't need this bulleted list, recommend deleting. You've described exactly these things in the callout table for the image (which is excellent, by the way!).-->
    
    - Create custom insight cards.

    - View popular, recent, high priority, and cards created by your organization. 

    - View information about the cards that are available for your organization in a tabular format.

    - Search for cards.
    
    The following is an example of an **Assistant Studio** page:

    > [!div class="mx-imgBorder"]
    > ![Assistant studio home page](media/si-admin-assistant-full-studio-home-page.png "Assistant studio home page")

    |  |  | 
    |--------|---------|
    | **1**<!--Callout tables don't usually have header rows, and in this case you really don't need to have a column devoted to the feature name, not when it works so well as part of the description. The very best way to format this would be to have orange numbers in this column that look exactly like the numbers in your image, but these numbers work well also.--> | Create cards with that are custom-made for your organization by using Power Automate. More information: [Creating custom insight cards](create-insight-cards-flow.md) |
    | **2** | Quickly view cards by using tabs to view cards that are most popular, recently used, high in priority, and created by your organization. |
    | **3** | Table with card details displays the cards that are available in your organization. More information: [Edit insight cards](edit-insight-cards.md)<!--This isn't the place to list everything you can do to a card AND give a link to the same information. --> |
    | **4** | Search for cards that you want to view or manage. |
    
5. On the **Optimize ranking** tab, you can create rules to prioritize cards to appear in the application.

    The following is an example of the **Optimize ranking** tab:

    > [!div class="mx-imgBorder"]
    > ![Optimize ranking tab](media/si-admin-assistant-optimize-ranking.png "Optimize ranking tab")

    To learn more, see [Optimize ranking of insight cards](optimize-ranking-insight-cards.md).

## Assistant studio tutorials

Assistant tutorials are available for you to learn how to create custom insight cards by using minimal or no code through Power Automate. Using the tutorials, you learn from creating a basic custom insight, a "hello world" equivalent, and gradually increase the complexity as you go along.

More information: [Assistant studio tutorials for Dynamics 365 Sales Insights](https://docs.microsoft.com/learn/modules/sales-insights-lab/)

## Disable teasers

The updates in Sales Insights are displayed to sellers as teasers in the assistant. By default, teasers are enabled in your organization. However, you can disable if you don’t wish to display the teasers. To disable, follow these steps:

1. Sign in to the Dynamics 365 Sales Hub app, and go to **Change area** > **Sales Insights settings**.

2. On the site map, select **Overview**.

3. In the **Teasers** section, turn off the toggle.

    > [!div class="mx-imgBorder"]
    > ![Disable teasers](media/disable-teasers.png "Disable teasers")

Teasers will be disabled in your organization.<!--This is also not strictly necessary because it's the outcome of this procedure, it's descriptive rather than prescriptive, but at least it doesn't describe something that the reader is currently looking at. I moved the indent to the left because it doesn't apply to the last step, it applies to the entire procedure.-->
