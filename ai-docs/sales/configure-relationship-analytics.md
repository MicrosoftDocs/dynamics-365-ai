    > [!TIP]
    > Alternatively, in the **Sales Insights settings** page, select **Manage** from the **Relationship analytics** section to go to configuration page.

5. (Optional) To enable the preview to view similar opportunities, under **Similar opportunities** on the **Relationship analytics** tab for opportunities, turn on the **Preview enabled** toggle.

    By enabling this option, users in your organization can see an improved Relationship analytics tab for opportunities. The tab displays customer interaction KPIs along with suggestions calculated from similar won opportunities through AI-driven models.

    >[!NOTE]
    >- The preview feature is available only for the Opportunity entity.
    >- You must have at least 30 won and 30 lost opportunities to compare with existing opportunities.
    >- To understand how users use this feature, see [View similar opportunities](relationship-analytics.md#relationship-analytics-with-similar-opportunities).

6. To show the relationship health score in opportunities, views, and charts, set the toggle to **On**.

    >[!NOTE]
    >You can disable the option if you don't wish to display the score in opportunities, views, and charts. However, disabling the option does not affect the process of gathering the relevant health data.

7. Adjust the importance of activities of different types as they contribute to the relationship health score.

    Businesses place different emphasis on the type of communication used with customers.The activities includes, Emails, Meetings, Phone calls, and Tasks.

8. Choose **Communication Frequency**. 

    Businesses have varying sales cycles and different expected levels of communications with customers. A longer expected communications frequency reduces the expectation of more recent frequent communications in the health score. A shorter expected communications frequency increases the expectation of more recent frequent communications in the health score.
