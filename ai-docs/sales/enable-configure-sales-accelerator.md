The sales accelerator helps sellers in your organization increase their sales productivity and prioritize activities for the day through the work list available in Sales Hub app. A sales manager uses the sequence designer to create a sequence of activities&mdash;separated by time intervals&mdash;including emails, phone calls, and tasks. The sequence is then applied to leads or opportunities, and assigned to a seller automatically according to your organization's sales strategies.

As an administrator, you must enable and configure the sales accelerator in your organization to make it available for sales managers and sellers to use. Follow these steps:

1. [Review the prerequisites and recommendation](#review-the-prerequisites-and-recommendations).

2. [Enable the preview](#enable-the-preview).

3. [Configure the Sales accelerator](#configure-the-sales-accelerator).

## Review the prerequisites and recommendations

### Prerequisites

Ensure that you meet the following requirements:

- Purchase a **Dynamics 365 Sales Insights** license, or start a trial to use advanced Sales Insights features.

- Enable advanced Sales Insights features. More information: [Install and configure premium Sales Insights features](intro-admin-guide-sales-insights.md#install-and-configure-premium-sales-insights-features).
