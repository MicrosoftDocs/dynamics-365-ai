# Configure predictive lead scoring

Predictive lead scoring uses a predictive machine learning model to calculate a score for all open leads. The score helps salespeople prioritize leads, achieve higher lead qualification rates, and reduce the time that it takes to qualify a lead.

Using this score, users can do the following:

-	Identify quality leads and convert them into opportunities.
-	Spend time on leads that have low scores, and convert them into possible opportunities.

For example, say you have two leads - Lead A and Lead B - in your pipeline. The lead scoring model applies a score of 80 for Lead A and 50 for Lead B. By looking at the score, you can predict that Lead A has more chances of converting into an opportunity and you can engage it. Also, you can further analyze why the score of Lead B is low by looking at the top reasons influencing the score and deciding whether to improve this score.

The following image is an example of lead scoring widget:

> [!div class="mx-imgBorder"]
> ![Predictive lead score widget](media/predictive-lead-scoring-widget.png "Predictive lead score widget")

>[!IMPORTANT]
>Important! If you are using the predictive lead scoring version that is before 2020 release wave 2 for Dynamics 365, delete the model. Since, the previous version model will be applied on all the leads in your organization and the newly generated models will not have any effect on the leads. To learn more, see [Delete a model](#delete-a-model).

Also, you can add custom fields to generate a model for predictive lead scoring that is accurate. The custom fields can be specific to your organization so that you can decide the impact of the outcome.

## Prerequisites

Verify the following requirement before adding predictive lead scoring models for your organization:

-	A minimum of 40 qualified and 40 disqualified leads within the past 18 months are required to enable the predictive model.

    >[!NOTE]
    >These numbers represent the minimum requirement. The more leads you can include to train the model, the better the prediction results will be.

## Understand the configuration page 

Before we configure the predictive lead scoring, let's understand the configuration summary page. When a model is generated and published, the configuration summary page is displayed as shown in the following image.

> [!div class="mx-imgBorder"]
> ![Configuration page](media/si-admin-predictive-lead-scoring-configuration-page.png "Configuration page")

Typically, the configuration page is organized into the following sections:

-	[Select model](#select-model)
-	[Actions you can perform on the model](#actions-you-can-perform-on-the-model)
-	[Version details](#version-details)
-	[Lead score grading](#lead-score-grading)
-	[MultiModel](#multimodel)

### Select model

On the upper-left section of the page, using **Select model** drop-down list, you can select the model you want to view, edit, or delete. The list consists of both published and unpublished models.

> [!div class="mx-imgBorder"]
> ![Select model drop-down](media/si-admin-predictive-lead-scoring-select-model-drop-down.png "Select model drop-down")

### Actions you can perform on the model

The upper-right section of the page displays the actions that you can perform on the model.

> [!div class="mx-imgBorder"]
> ![Actions for lead scoring](media/si-admin-predictive-lead-scoring-buttons.png "Actions for lead scoring")

-	**Publish**: When you publish a model to your organization, users in your organization can see the My Open Leads Scored system view and the Lead score widget on lead forms. After you publish, the button grays out and will be available only after you retrain or edit the model.
-	**Edit model**: You can update or add fields that affect the prediction accuracy score. This is useful when you want to tweak the model to modify fields to consider or include a unique business process. More information: [Edit and retrain a model](#edit-and-retrain-a-model)
-	**Revert version**: You can return the model to its previous version when the retrained model isn't satisfactory or doesn't meet an acceptable level of your organization's requirements. This action is available only when you retrain a model, but you haven't yet published it.
-	**Delete model**: You can delete models that are not required in your organization. This option is displayed for published models. To learn more, see [Delete a model](#delete-a-model).

### Version details

The parameters displayed in this section show information about the status and performance of the model.

> [!div class="mx-imgBorder"]
> ![Version details for the lead scoring model](media/si-admin-predictive-lead-scoring-version-details.png "Version details for the lead scoring model")

| Parameter | Description |
|-----------|-------------|
| Version trained on | Displays a date that lets you know when the model was last trained. |
| Status | Displays whether the model is active or inactive. |
| Attributes used | Displays the number of attributes used from the available list to train the model. If you're not satisfied with the outcome of the trained model, you can select **Retrain with recommended fields** to retrain the model with the standard (out-of-the-box) attributes. If the parameter displays **Edited** next to the number of attributes used, this specifies that the attributes used are custom-selected. |
| Model performance | Displays information about the model's accuracy and projected performance based on the data available and selected to train the model.<br>**Note**: The range of the accuracy score is defined based on the area under the curve (AUC) classification measurements.<br>-	**Ready to publish** specifies that the model accuracy is above the range, and you can expect that the model will perform well.<br>-	**OK to publish** specifies that the model accuracy is within range, and you can expect that the model might perform reasonably well.<br>-	**Not ready to publish** specifies that the model accuracy is below the range, and you can expect that the model will perform poorly. |
| Business process flow | Displays the business process flow that is applied on the leads that are scored by this model. |
| Filter column and filter values | When multiple models are used, this selection defines which column and which values within that column correspond to the leads that this specific model should score. |
| State option set | Displayed the option set that is used to qualify and disqualify leads in this model. |
| Retrain automatically | Allows you to set the model to retrain automatically. More information: [Automatic retraining](#automatic-retraining). |
| Most influential fields | Displays the top five attributes that most affect the outcome of the prediction accuracy score. |

### Lead score grading

When a model is published, the leads that are in your organization's pipeline are graded according to the range defined in this section. Each lead in the pipeline is graded A, B, C, or D, according to the lead score. Leads in the top score range are graded A while leads within the lowest score range are graded D. 

> [!div class="mx-imgBorder"]
> ![Grading of lead scores](media/si-admin-predictive-lead-scoring-grading.png "Grading of lead scores")

You can configure the range for the grading according to your organizational requirements. When you change the lead score range for a grade, the maximum range value for the adjacent grade changes automatically in accordance with the change in the minimum value. For example, when you change the minimum range value score for **Grade A** to 51, the maximum lead score range for **Grade B** changes to 50.

### MultiModel

On the bottom-left section of the page, you can use **Add model** generate a new model to represent a line of business that might use different leads than your first model. The **Add model** option will be disabled once you reach the maximum limit of 10 models (both published and unpublished). To learn more, see [Add a model](#add-a-model).

> [!div class="mx-imgBorder"]
> ![Add a model option](media/si-admin-predictive-lead-scoring-add-model.png "Add a model option")

## First-run set up experience

When the predictive lead scoring configuration section is opened for the first time in your organization and there are no models trained on install, you must add the model. 

However, if your organization has enough leads that match the application default configurations, then a model is generated, by default, and a popup is displayed with the prediction accuracy score and top five fields that are influencing the score. Based on your organizationâ€™s requirements, you can publish the model, or edit and publish the model.

If you are using your custom attributes for lead generation, you can generate the model by configuring the parameters with your custom attributes.

>[!NOTE]
>Before you configure the model, review the [prerequisites](#prerequisites).

1. Verify that advanced Sales Insights features are enabled. To learn more, see [Install and configure premium Sales Insights features](intro-admin-guide-sales-insights.md#install-and-configure-premium-sales-insights-features). 

2. Go to **Change area** on the bottom-left of the page and select **Sales Insights settings**.

    > [!div class="mx-imgBorder"]
    > ![Select Sales Insights settings option](media/si-admin-change-area-sales-insights-settings.png "Select Sales Insights settings option")

3. On the sitemap, select **Lead scoring** under **Predictive models**.

    > [!TIP]
    > Alternatively, in the **Sales Insights settings** page, select **Set up** from the **Predictive lead scoring** section to go to configuration page.

    The **Predictive lead scoring** configuration page is displayed.

    > [!div class="mx-imgBorder"]
    > ![Predictive lead scoring add model page](media/si-admin-predictive-lead-scoring-add-model-page.png "Predictive lead scoring add model page")

4. Enter a name for **New model name**. The name must contain only alphanumeric and underscore. Spaces and other special characters are not allowed in the name.

    By default, the name is selected as LeadScoring_<*YYYYMMDD*><*Time*>. For example, **LeadScoring_202009181410**. The date and time are based on Coordinated Universal Time (UTC).

5. Select a business process flow that is relevant for the leads for which you are generating the model in the **Business process flow** drop-down list. The values displayed in the list are the business process flows that are defined for leads in your organization. 

    A business process flow defines a set of steps that users can perform to achieve an outcome. An organization may have multiple business process flows to represent the work of different security roles or lines of business.
    
    For custom business process flow entities, you must enable them for analytics and to be able select. To learn more, see [Configure Entity For Managed Lake](https://dynamics.wiki/index.php/Configure_Entity_For_Managed_Lake).

6. Select the option set in which the status of the leads is defined in the **State option set** drop-down list. After you select the option set, the select the corresponding qualified and disqualified values in **Qualified value** and **Disqualified value** drop-down lists, respectively. 

    Leads are marked as:
    -	Qualified when they have met certain criteria that denotes that they are ready to purchase a product or service from a business. 
    -	Disqualified when the criteria are not met. 
    
    The out-of-box-state option set **Status** contains the qualified and disqualified values as **Qualified** and **Disqualified**, respectively. You can also select your custom option set that is relevant to your business.

7. Select **Filter column** and **Filter values** to define the leads for which the model must score. 

    With multiple models, each model can be directed to score a specific set of leads based on the line of business they belong to or based on other criteria. The filter column is the column that holds the value that distinguishes which leads the model should score. These selections determine which column and which values within that column correspond to the leads that this model should score.

8. Select **Get started**. 

    The application starts generating a model, and a notification is displayed on the screen. The application uses the standard attributes to generate the model.

    > [!div class="mx-imgBorder"]
    > ![Model training notification](media/si-admin-predictive-lead-scoring-model-training-notification.png "Model training notification")

    >[!NOTE]
    >If there are not enough leads to generate the model, an error message is displayed. Review and edit the configurations and try generating the model again.

9. After the model is generated, the lead scoring configuration page is displayed with the version summary such as, model performance, top fields that are influencing, and the option to choose to automatically retrain the model. 

10.	Select **Publish**. If the score's accuracy is at an acceptable level as per your organization's standard. 

    The model is applied to the selected set of leads in your organization. Users can see the lead scoring in their views under the **Lead score** column and a widget in the lead form. More information: [Convert leads into opportunities](../sales/work-predictive-lead-scoring.md). 

    >[!NOTE]
    >Select View details if the score's accuracy is not at an acceptable level. You can review the details of the model and edit the fields to improve the score's accuracy. To learn more, see [Edit and retrain a model](#edit-and-retrain-a-model).

## Add a model

In organizations with different lines of business, you may need different models to score the corresponding leads. To accomplish this, you can add and publish multiple models that are specific to each line of businesses in your organization. To ensure that these models are accurate for your organization, you can choose custom attributes (fields) to be used to generate the lead score for a model. 

1.	Go to the predictive lead scoring configuration summary page.

2.	At the bottom-left of the page, select **Add model**.

    > [!div class="mx-imgBorder"]
    > ![Select add model](media/si-admin-predictive-lead-scoring-model-select-add-model.png "Select add model")

    >[!NOTE]
    >If you have 10 models that include both published and unpublished, the **Add model** option is disabled. Delete the models that are no more required in your organization. To learn more, see [Delete a model](#delete-a-model).
    
    The configure model page displays.
 
    > [!div class="mx-imgBorder"]
    > ![Predictive lead scoring add model page](media/si-admin-predictive-lead-scoring-model-add-model-page.png "Predictive lead scoring add model page") 

3.	Perform steps 4 to 8 from [First-run set up experience](#first-run-set-up-experience) to add the model. 

4. After the model is generated, a confirmation notification displays with a model performance message, top fields that are influencing, and the option to choose to automatically retrain the model. 

    > [!div class="mx-imgBorder"]
    > ![Model training confirmation notification](media/si-admin-predictive-lead-scoring-model-confirmation-notification.png "Model training confirmation notification")

5.	Select **Publish**. If the score's accuracy is at an acceptable level as per your organization's standard. 

    The model is applied to the selected set of opportunities in your organization. Users can see the lead scoring in their views under the **Lead score** column and a widget in the lead form. More information: [Prioritize leads through scores](../sales/work-predictive-lead-scoring.md). 

    >[!NOTE]
    >Select View details if the score's accuracy is not at an acceptable level. You can review the details of the model and edit the fields to improve the score's accuracy. To learn more, see [Edit and retrain a model](#edit-and-retrain-a-model).

## Edit and retrain a model

It's time to retrain a model when its prediction accuracy score doesn't match your organization's standards, or simply when it gets old. Retraining generally increases the prediction accuracy score. The application uses the latest data (leads) from your organization to train the model so that it can provide more accurate scores for your users.

>[!NOTE]
>For better prediction accuracy scoring, retrain a model after the data in your organization is refreshed. 

You can retrain the model [automatically](#automatic-retraining) or [manually](#manually-retraining). Both methods are described in the following sections.

### Automatic retraining

Automatic retraining allows the application to retrain a model automatically once every 15 days. This can allow the model to learn from historical data and improve its prediction accuracy over time. Depending on the model's accuracy, the application makes an informed decision whether to publish or ignore the retrained model.

To retrain a model automatically, go to the predictive lead scoring configuration page and enable **Retrain automatically**. By default, this option is enabled when a model is published. Here are the scenarios where the application automatically publishes the model:

- When the accuracy of the retrained model is equal to or greater than 95 percent of the accuracy of the active model.
- When the current model is more than three months old. 

    >[!NOTE]
    >A retrained model may not publish if the accuracy of the model is not maintained at applicationâ€™s standard and the existing user published model will be retained.

### Manually retraining

1. Go to the predictive lead scoring configuration page and select **Edit model**.

2. On the **Edit fields** page, select your custom attributes from **Main Entity** and **Related Entities**.

    > [!div class="mx-imgBorder"]
    > ![Edit model page](media/si-admin-predictive-lead-scoring-edit-model-page.png "Edit model page")

3. Select **Retrain model**. 

    The model starts to generate with the selected custom attributes and a notification is displayed on the screen.

4.	On the configuration summary page, review the model performance and other parameters. If the retrained model satisfies your organizational requirements, publish the model.

    >[!NOTE]
    >If the parameters of the retrained model are not satisfactory, edit the attributes and retrain the model. 

## Delete a model

You can delete a model when itâ€™s no longer required in your organization. You can have only 10 models that include both published and unpublished, simultaneously.

1. Go to the predictive lead scoring configuration page.

2. Select a model from **Select model** and then select **Delete model**. In this example, we have selected the model **LeadScoring_202009181011**.

    >[!NOTE]
    >You canâ€™t delete a model if the **Retrain automatically** option is enabled. Disable the option to delete.

    > [!div class="mx-imgBorder"]
    > ![Delete a model](media/si-admin-predictive-lead-scoring-delete-model.png "Delete a model")

    A confirmation message appears.

3. On the confirmation message, select **Delete**.
    
    The model is deleted from your organization.

## Add the lead scoring widget to a form

By default, the predictive lead scoring widget is available only in the out-of-the-box **Sales Insights** form. If you're using customized forms for leads, you can display the predictive lead scoring widget on your custom forms by following these steps.
