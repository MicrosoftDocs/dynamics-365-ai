# Edit a sequence

If your organization changes its selling process, you might want to edit a sequence to reflect the changes. You can only edit a sequence that's in an inactive state, so you must deactivate it first.

**To edit a sequence**   
1. Sign in to your sales app.   
2. Go to **Change area** in the lower-left corner of the page and select **Sales Insights settings**.   
3. Under **Sales accelerator**, select **Sequence**.     
4. On the **Sequences** page, verify the state of the sequence you want to edit:   
   - If the sequence is **Inactive**, skip to step 5.      
   - If the sequence is **Active**, select it, and then select **More options** > **Deactivate**.    
4. Select and open the sequence. Do one of the following:   
    - To add an activity, perform **step 7** from [Create and activate a sequence](create-and-activate-a-sequence.md).       
    - To edit an activity, select **More options** > **Edit**.   
        > [!div class="mx-imgBorder"]
        > ![Edit an activity](media/sequence-edit-activity.png "Edit an activity")     
        Make the edits you want, and then select **Save**.      
6. (Optional) If you want the sequence to be available to connect with records, select **Activate**.    
7. Save and exit the sequence designer.
