# Connect a sequence to records

After you create and activate a sequence for the selling process, you connect the sequence to records depending on the entity that you've created the sequence for. When a sequence is connected to an entity, the activities defined in the sequence will be shown in order on the record's **Summary** under **Up next** in **My work**.   
> [!NOTE]
> You can connect a sequence to the following types of records only:
> - Leads that are in a **New** state.
> - Opportunities that are in an **Open** state.    

You can connect a sequence to records in the following ways:    
- [Through a sequence](#ContactThroughASequence)
- [Through the lead or opportunity grid view](#ContactThroughGridView)
- [Through a record](#ContactThroughARecord)
- [Through Power Automate](#through-power-automate)

## Through a sequence   

>[!NOTE]
>In this procedure, we're considering a sequence that was created based on **Lead** as an example. For sequences that are based on **Opportunity**, the procedure is similar.

1. Sign in to your sales app.   
2. Go to **Change area** in the lower-left corner of the page, and select **Sales Insights settings**.   
3. Under **Sales accelerator**, select **Sequence**.   
4. On the **Sequences** page, select the **Active** tab.    
    >[!NOTE]
    > You can assign records only to sequences that are in an **Active** state.

    > [!div class="mx-imgBorder"]
    > ![Active sequences list view](media/sequence-home-page-active-sequence.png "Active sequences list view")       
5. Select and open the sequence for which you want to assign records.<br>or<br>Hover over a sequence, and then select **More options** > **View sequence**.    
    The sequence opens. On the **Manage sequence** tab, you can view the activities that are defined for the sequence.     
    > [!div class="mx-imgBorder"]
    > ![Manage sequence tab of a sequence](media/sequence-manage-sequence-tab.png "Manage sequence tab of a sequence")     
6. Select the **Connected Lead** tab.    
    You can see the list of records that are connected to the sequence.    
7.	To add a record, select **+ Connect Leads**.     
    > [!div class="mx-imgBorder"]
    > ![Connected leads tab of a sequence](media/sequence-connected-leads-tab.png "Connected leads tab of a sequence")   
    The list that appears shows available lead records that aren't connected to any sequence.
    > [!div class="mx-imgBorder"]
    > ![List of available lead records](media/sequence-list-of-available-leads.png "List of available lead records")   
8.	Choose the records that you want to connect to the sequence, and then select **Connect**.     
    Verify that the **Open leads without sequences** view is selected. Selecting this view helps to list only the records that aren't associated with other sequences. You can select other views to choose records to connect, but the records in that view must not be associated with other sequences.     
    > [!div class="mx-imgBorder"]
    > ![Select lead records to connect](media/sequence-select-leads-to-connect.png "Select lead records to connect")

The lead records are connected to the sequence and are added to the list of connected records.

## Through the lead or opportunity grid view   

1. Sign in to your sales app.   
2. Go to **Change area** in the lower-left corner of the page, and select **Sales**.   
3. Under **Sales**, select **Leads** or **Opportunities**, depending on the records you want to connect.   
    In this example, we select **Leads**.   
    > [!div class="mx-imgBorder"]
    > ![Lead view](media/sequence-connect-lead-view.png "Lead view")        
4. Select the records to which you want to connect the sequence. In this example, we select **Sharon Thonpson** and **Christopher Anderson**.   
    > [!div class="mx-imgBorder"]
    > ![Select leads to connect the sequence to](media/sequence-select-leads-connect-sequence.png "Select leads to connect the sequence to")   

    > [!NOTE]
    >- You can't connect a sequence to a record that has already been connected with a different sequence. When you select a record that was already connected, the **Disconnect sequence** option appears on the toolbar. To connect to a different sequence, select **Disconnect sequence**. The record will be available to connect to the sequence you want.      
    >- When you choose multiple sequences to connect, and the chosen list contains both connected and disconnected records, no option to connect or disconnect will be displayed on the toolbar.    
5. Select **Connect sequence**. The list of available sequences that appears includes sequences created by you and other sales managers.   
    In this example, a list of sequences that are configured for the **Lead** entity is displayed.    
    > [!div class="mx-imgBorder"]
    > ![List of sequences for leads](media/sequence-lead-list-sequence.png "List of sequences for leads")   
6. Select a sequence, and then select **Connect**.

A confirmation message appears at the bottom of the page, and the sequence is connected to the selected lead records. Now, sellers who have access to the lead record can see the activities connected with it.   

<a name="ContactThroughARecord"></a>
## Through a record   

1. Sign in to your sales app.   
2. Go to **Change area** in the lower-left corner of the page, and select **Sales**.   
3. Under **Sales**, select **Leads** or **Opportunities**, depending on the records you want to connect.   
    In this example, we select **Leads**.   
    > [!div class="mx-imgBorder"]
    > ![Lead view](media/sequence-connect-lead-view.png "Lead view")       
4. Open the record to which you want to connect the sequence. In this example, we opened the lead **Sharon Thonpson**.   
    > [!div class="mx-imgBorder"]
    > ![Open a lead to connect the sequence to](media/sequence-open-lead-connect-sequence.png "Open a lead to connect the sequence to")   
    > [!NOTE]
    >  When you select a record that was already connected, the **Disconnect sequence** option appears on the toolbar. Disconnect the record from the sequence it's currently connected with, and then connect it to the sequence you want. More information: [View details of a sequence and its connected records](view-sequence-details-connected-records.md)       
5. Select **Connect sequence**. The list of available sequences that appears includes sequences created by you and other sales managers.   
    In this example, a list of sequences that are configured for the **Lead** entity is displayed.    
    > [!div class="mx-imgBorder"]
    > ![List of sequences for leads](media/sequence-lead-list-sequence.png "List of sequences for leads")    
6. Select a sequence, and then select **Connect**.

A confirmation message appears at the bottom of the page, and the sequence is connected to the selected lead records. Now, sellers who have access to the lead record can see the activities connected with it.

## Through Power Automate

You can create a flow based on a sequence. The flow connects the records automatically to the sequence when the trigger satisfies the flow condition.

1.	Go to [Microsoft Power Automate](https://flow.microsoft.com), and sign in with your Dynamics 365 credentials.    
    >[!NOTE]
    >By default, your organization is selected based on your latest association. If you have multiple organizations associated with you, select the proper organization from your profile settings.    
2.	Select **Solutions**, and then select **Default Solution**.    
    > [!div class="mx-imgBorder"]
    > ![Select the default solution in Power Automate](media/sequence-power-automate-select-solution.png "Select the default solution in Power Automate")    
    All default solutions are listed.
3.	In the search box on the toolbar, search for the flow that you want update or view.     
    > [!div class="mx-imgBorder"]
    > ![Search for your solution](media/si-admin-view-flows-search-solution.png "Search for your solution")
4. Configure a trigger to the flow.    
5. Select **+ New step**.   
6. In the **Search connectors and actions** box, select **Common Data Services**, and then search for and add the action **Perform an unbound action**.     
    > [!div class="mx-imgBorder"]
    > ![Search and add Perform an unbound action](media/sequence-add-an-unbound-action.png "Search and add Perform an unbound action")     
7.	In the **Perform an unbound action** step, select the **Action Name** as **msdyn_ConnectSequence**.     
    > [!div class="mx-imgBorder"]
    > ![Select the action name](media/sequence-select-action-name.png "Select the action name")       
    Enter the following additional information:     
    -	**RegardingEntityId**: The unique identifier of the entity record that is to be connected to the sequence.    
    -	**RegardingEntityName**: The logical name of the entity.    
    -	**SequenceId**: The unique identifier of the sequence.    
        To get the unique identifier of the sequence, query OData for the sequence entity (**msdyn_sequence**). More information: [Querying or browsing an OData endpoint](/dynamics365/fin-ops-core/dev-itpro/data-entities/odata#querying-or-browsing-an-odata-endpoint)     
8. Use **Flow Checker** to verify errors and warnings in the flow.   
    Errors and warnings in the flow cause performance or reliability issues. Ensure that the flow is free from errors and warnings. The checker is always active, appearing in the command bar in the designer. The checker shows a red dot when it finds one or more errors in your flow.   
    For example, while creating a **For due date coming up** card, you haven't entered **Card Name**. The flow checker identifies the error and displays a red dot.     
    > [!NOTE]
    > You must resolve all errors and warnings to save the flow.     
9. (Optional) Select **Test** to test your flow.     
    Ensure that all the configured steps are working as required. The test feature runs and validates each step in the flow, and highlights any step that contains an error. You must resolve the error to proceed.    
    Select an option to test the flow by triggering actions or by using the data from previous test runs, and then select **Save & Test**.     
    > [!div class="mx-imgBorder"]   
    > ![Select Test flow type](media/si-admin-create-flow-select-test-flow.png "Select Test flow type")           
10. Save and publish the flow.
