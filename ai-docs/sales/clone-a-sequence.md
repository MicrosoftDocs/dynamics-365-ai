# Clone a sequence

You can clone a sequence to make it easier to add or remove steps, and save the changes to create new sequence. Cloning a sequence pulls down a full copy of the sequence data that you are cloning at that point in time, including all steps and configurations. After you make the changes you can save and activate the cloned sequence and apply it records.   
**To clone a sequence**   
1. Sign in to your sales app.   
2. Go to **Change area** in the lower-left corner of the page and select **Sales Insights settings**.   
3. Under **Sales accelerator**, select **Sequence**.   
4. Hover over a sequence and select **More options** > **Create a copy**.   
    > [!div class="mx-imgBorder"]
    > ![Select create a copy](media/sequence-clone-copy-sequence.png "Select create a copy")  
6. On the **Create a copy** dialog, enter the name of the sequence and description.    
    > [!div class="mx-imgBorder"]
    > ![Enter the name of the sequence and description](media/sequence-clone-name-description-dialog.png "Enter the name of the sequence and description")
