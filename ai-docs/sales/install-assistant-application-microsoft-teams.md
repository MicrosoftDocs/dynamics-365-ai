When you add the application to the Microsoft Teams desktop app, you can open the app on the Teams mobile app and access the information as required. To learn more, see [Access Dynamics 365 assistant application](access-assistant-application-teams.md). 

## Install Dynamics 365 assistant app

1. Verify that you have reviewed prerequisites. To learn more, see [Configure Dynamics 365 assistant application on Microsoft Teams](dynamics-365-assistant-app-teams.md#configure-dynamics-365-assistant-application-on-microsoft-teams).

2. Open the Microsoft Teams desktop application and go to **Apps**.

3. On the Apps page, search for "dynamics" and then select the **Dynamics 365** tile.
