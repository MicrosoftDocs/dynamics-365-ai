# Work with LinkedIn activities

As a seller, you can use LinkedIn network, which contains millions of users with a unique depth and quality of information to research and connect with your customers. This functionality allows you to use LinkedIn Sales Navigator in your sequence to recommend the next best action.

When a sequence contains steps that are related to LinkedIn activities, you can do the following actions on the steps to interact with customers:

-	Do research on customer to know better. More information: [Research activity](#research-activity)
-	Get introduced to a customer. More information: [Get introduced activity](#get-introduced-activity)
-	Send personal messages to connect. More information: [Connect activity](#connect-activity)
-	Send an InMail to customer. More information: [Send InMail activity](#send-inmail-activity)
