# Manage sequences

Sequences help sales managers enforce best practices by introducing a set of consecutive activities for sellers to follow during the course of their day. A manager can connect sequences to leads and opportunities that appear in a seller's work queue, to help sellers prioritize activities to focus on selling, be more productive, and better align to business processes.

As a sequence manager, you can use the sequence designer to:  
- [Create and activate a sequence](create-and-activate-a-sequence.md).
- [Connect a sequence to records](connect-a-sequence-to-records.md).
- [View details of a sequence and its connected records](view-sequence-details-connected-records.md).
- [Clone a sequence](clone-a-sequence.md).
- [Edit a sequence](edit-a-sequence.md).
- [Delete a sequence](delete-a-sequence.md).

## Review prerequisites

Before you start, be sure you have met the following prerequisites:   
- You must have the sequence manager, sales manager, or administrator role. More information: [Assign a security role to a user](/power-platform/admin/create-users-assign-online-security-roles#assign-a-security-role-to-a-user).   
- The sales accelerator has been configured in your organization. More information: [Configure the sales accelerator](enable-configure-sales-accelerator.md).
