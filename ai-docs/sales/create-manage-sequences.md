# Create and manage sequences

Sequences help sales managers enforce best practices by introducing a set of consecutive activities for sellers to follow during the course of their day. A manager can connect sequences to leads and opportunities that appear in a seller's work queue, to help sellers prioritize activities to focus on selling, be more productive, and better align to business processes.

As a sequence manager, you can use the sequence designer to:  
- [Create and activate a sequence](create-and-activate-a-sequence.md).
- [Connect a sequence to records](connect-a-sequence-to-records.md).
- [View details of a sequence and its connected records](view-sequence-details-connected-records.md).
- [Clone a sequence](clone-a-sequence.md).
- [Edit a sequence](edit-a-sequence.md).
- [Delete a sequence](delete-a-sequence.md).

## Review prerequisites

Before you start, be sure you have met the following prerequisites:   
- You must have the sequence manager, sales manager, or administrator role. More information: [Assign a security role to a user](https://docs.microsoft.com/power-platform/admin/create-users-assign-online-security-roles#assign-a-security-role-to-a-user).   
- The sales accelerator has been configured in your organization. More information: [Enable and configure the sales accelerator](enable-configure-sales-accelerator.md).

</td></tr>
</table>   


## Delete a sequence

You can delete sequences that your organization no longer needs, and they'll be deleted permanently from the app. You can delete active or inactive sequences. When you delete an active sequence, the records that were connected with the sequence will be disconnected from it.

**To delete a sequence**

1. Sign in to the **Sales Hub** app.   
2. At the bottom of the site map, select **Change area** > **Sales Insights settings**.   
3. Under **Acceleration**, select **Sequence (preview)**.   
4. On the **Sequences (preview)** page, hover over the sequence you want to delete, and then select **More options** > **Delete**.   
5. In the confirmation message that appears, select **Delete permanently**.
