Sequences help sales managers enforce best practices by introducing a set of consecutive activities for sellers to follow during the course of their day. A manager can connect sequences to leads and opportunities that appear in a seller's work queue, to help sellers prioritize activities to focus on selling, be more productive, and better align to business processes.

As a sales manager, you can use the sequence designer to:

- [Create and activate a sequence](#create-and-activate-a-sequence).
- [Connect a sequence to records](#connect-a-sequence-to-records).
- [View details of a sequence and its connected records](#view-details-of-a-sequence-and-its-connected-records).
- [Edit a sequence](#edit-a-sequence).
- [Delete a sequence](#delete-a-sequence).

## Review prerequisites

Before you start, be sure you have met the following prerequisites:

- You have the **Sequence Manager** security role. More information: [Assign a security role to a user](https://docs.microsoft.com/power-platform/admin/create-users-assign-online-security-roles#assign-a-security-role-to-a-user).

- The sales accelerator has been enabled and installed in your organization. More information: [Enable and configure the sales accelerator](enable-configure-sales-accelerator.md).

## Create and activate a sequence

Every organization has its own selling processes for sellers to follow. A sequence helps sellers overcome any inconsistencies in training or lack of documentation as they progress through the sales journey. When you create a sequence, you define the activities you want your sellers to perform&mdash;and the order to perform them in&mdash;as they handle leads and opportunities. This lets sellers concentrate on selling and gives them a better understanding of what to do next.

**To create and activate a sequence**

1. Sign in to the **Sales Hub** app.

2. At the bottom of the site map, select **Change area** > **Sales Insights settings**.

3. Under **Acceleration**, select **Sequence (preview)**.

4. On the **Sequences (preview)** page, select **+ New sequence**.

    > [!div class="mx-imgBorder"]
    > ![Create a sequence dialog box](media/sequence-create-sequence.png "Create a sequence dialog box")

5. In the **Create a sequence** dialog dox, enter the following information:

    | Parameter | Description |
    |-----------|-------------|
    | Sequence name | The name of the sequence. |
    | Description | A description of the sequence. (Optional) |
    | Entity | The entity type for which you want to apply this sequence. By default, the Lead entity type is selected. |

6. Select **Next**.

7. Choose and configure one of the following activities:

    > [!div class="mx-imgBorder"]
    > ![Choose an activity](media/sequence-choose-activity.png "Choose an activity")
    
    - **Email**: Creates an email activity for sellers to communicate with customers. When this activity is shown to the seller, an envelope icon is displayed on the record. When a seller selects the icon, an email composer opens with a template if one was selected. If no template was selected, an empty email composer opens.

        > [!div class="mx-imgBorder"]
        > ![Add an email activity](media/sequence-activity-add-email.png "Add an email activity") 

        Enter the following information to configure the email activity:

        1. A name and description for the activity. The information you enter here will be displayed to sellers.

        2. If templates are available for your organization, in the **Assign email template** box, select the template you want to assign for this step.

        3. Save the activity.

         > [!div class="mx-imgBorder"]
         > ![Email activity](media/sequence-activity-email-created.png "Email activity")

    - **Phone call**: Creates a phone call activity for sellers to communicate with customers. When this activity is shown to the seller, a phone icon is displayed on the record. When sellers select the icon, a softphone appears on the app to dial the customer.

        > [!div class="mx-imgBorder"]
        > ![Add a phone call activity](media/sequence-activity-add-phone-call.png "Add a phone call activity") 

        Enter a name and description for the phone call activity, and then select **Save**. The information you enter here will be displayed to sellers.

        > [!div class="mx-imgBorder"]
        > ![Phone call activity](media/sequence-activity-phone-call-created.png "Phone call activity")

    - **Task**: Creates a custom activity that you define, such as scheduling a meeting and meet the customer on the field that are not specified in the activity selector.

        > [!div class="mx-imgBorder"]
        > ![Add a custom task activity](media/sequence-activity-add-task.png "Add a custom task activity")

        Enter the name and description of the custom activity, and then select **Save**. The information you enter here will be displayed to sellers.

        > [!div class="mx-imgBorder"]
        > ![Task activity](media/sequence-activity-task-created.png "Task activity")

    - **Set wait time**: Specifies the interval between activities&mdash;that is, after an activity is completed and before the next activity occurs&mdash;during which sellers need to wait. A sequence can't start or end with this activity.  

        When this activity is shown to sellers on a record, they don't need to perform any action; they simply need to wait until the wait time expires before they perform the next activity.  

        > [!div class="mx-imgBorder"]
        > ![Set wait time](media/sequence-activity-add-set-wait-time.png "Set wait time")

        Choose the duration in days and hours that you want sellers to wait before they perform the next activity, and then select **Save**. The maximum wait time is 30 days.

        > [!div class="mx-imgBorder"]
        > ![Add wait time](media/sequence-activity-set-wait-time-created.png "Add wait time")

8. Select the **Add** icon, and then repeat **step 7** for all the activities that you want to add to the sequence. 

9. Select **More options** in the upper-right corner of the page, and then select **Save**.

10. Select **More options** again, and then select **Activate** to activate the sequence.
    
11. Select **Yes** in the confirmation message that appears.

    >[!NOTE]
    >An error might occur if you've added **Set wait time** as the last activity of the sequence. You must delete this last **Set wait time** activity, and then save and activate the sequence.  
    
    The sequence is activated and listed in the sequence designer home page.

   > [!div class="mx-imgBorder"]
   > ![Sequence designer home page](media/sequence-home-page.png "Sequence designer home page") 

Next, you connect the active sequence to lead or opportunity records.

## Connect a sequence to records

After you create and activate the sequence for the selling process, you connect the sequence to records depending on the entity that you've created the sequence for. When a sequence is connected to an entity, the activities defined in the sequence will be shown in order on the record's **Summary** under **Up next** in **My work**.

>[!NOTE]
>- You must have the sequence manager, sales manager, or administrator role to access and connect a sequence to records.
>- You can connect sequence to the following type of records only:
>   - Leads that are in **New** state.
>   - Opportunities that are in **Open** state. 

You can connect a sequence to records in the following ways:

- [Through the lead or opportunity grid view](#ContactThroughGridView)
- [Through a record](#ContactThroughARecord)
- [Through a sequence](#ContactThroughASequence)

<a name="ContactThroughGridView"></a>
**Through the lead or opportunity grid view**

1. Sign in to the **Sales Hub** app.

2. Go to **Change area** in the lower-left corner of the page and select **Sales**.

3. Under **Sales**, select **Leads** or **Opportunities**, depending on the records you want to connect.

    In this example, we select **Leads**.

    > [!div class="mx-imgBorder"]
    > ![Lead view](media/sequence-connect-lead-view.png "Lead view")
    
4. Select the records to which you want to connect the sequence. In this example, we select **Nancy Anderson** and **Maria Campbell**.

    > [!div class="mx-imgBorder"]
    > ![Select leads to connect the sequence to](media/sequence-select-leads-connect-sequence.png "Select leads to connect the sequence to")

    >[!NOTE]
    >You can't connect a sequence to a record that has already been connected with a different sequence. You must remove the record from the sequence it's currently connected with, and then connect it to the sequence you want. More information: [View details of a sequence and its connected records](#view-details-of-a-sequence-and-its-connected-records)

5. Select **Connect sequence**. The list of available sequences that appears includes sequences created by you and other sales managers.

    In this example, a list of sequences that are configured for the **Lead** entity is displayed. 

    > [!div class="mx-imgBorder"]
    > ![List of sequences for leads](media/sequence-lead-list-sequence.png "List of sequences for leads")

6. Select a sequence, and then select **Connect**.

    A confirmation message appears at the bottom of the page, and the sequence is connected to the selected lead records. Now, sellers who have access to the lead record can see the activities connected with it.

<a name="ContactThroughARecord"></a>
**Through a record**

1. Sign in to the **Sales Hub** app.

2. Go to **Change area** in the lower-left corner of the page and select **Sales**.

4. Open a record to which you want to connect the sequence. In this example, we opened the lead **Nancy Anderson**.

    > [!div class="mx-imgBorder"]
    > ![Open a leads to connect the sequence to](media/sequence-open-lead-connect-sequence.png "Open a lead to connect the sequence to")

    >[!NOTE]
    >You can't connect a sequence to a record that has already been connected with a different sequence. You must remove the record from the sequence it's currently connected with, and then connect it to the sequence you want. More information: [View details of a sequence and its connected records](#view-details-of-a-sequence-and-its-connected-records).
    
5. Select **Connect sequence**. The list of available sequences that appears includes sequences created by you and other sales managers.

    In this example, a list of sequences that are configured for the **Lead** entity is displayed. 

    > [!div class="mx-imgBorder"]
    > ![List of sequences for leads](media/sequence-lead-list-sequence.png "List of sequences for leads")

6. Select a sequence, and then select **Connect**.

    A confirmation message appears at the bottom of the page, and the sequence is connected to the selected lead records. Now, sellers who have access to the lead record can see the activities connected with it.

<a name="ContactThroughASequence"></a>
**Through a sequence**

1. Sign in to the **Sales Hub** app.

2. Go to **Change area** in the lower-left corner of the page and select **Sales Insights settings**.

5. Hover over a sequence, and then select **More options** > **Properties**. 

    > [!div class="mx-imgBorder"]
    > ![Select properties](media/sequence-active-sequence-select-properties.png "Select properties")

    The sequence opens in the **Summary** view. You can view the details of the sequence such as the name of the sequence, its owner, its status, the entity that the sequence is connected with, and the total number of activities defined in it.

    > [!div class="mx-imgBorder"]
    > ![Active sequence summary page](media/sequence-active-sequence-summary.png "Active sequence summary page")

6. Select the **Connected records** tab and then select **Connect records**.

    > [!div class="mx-imgBorder"]
    > ![Select connect records](media/sequence-select-connect-records.png "Select connect records")

    The record is removed from the list and can be connected to a different sequence.

## Edit a sequence

If your organization changes its selling process, you might want to edit a sequence to reflect the changes. You can only edit a sequence that's in an inactive state, so you must deactivate it first.

**To edit a sequence**

1. Sign in to the **Sales Hub** app.

2. At the bottom of the site map, select **Change area** > **Sales Insights settings**.

3. Under **Acceleration**, select **Sequence (preview)**.

4. On the **Sequences (preview)** page, verify the state of the sequence you want to edit:

   - If the sequence is **Inactive**, skip to step 5.
   
   - If the sequence is **Active**, select it, and then select **More options** > **Deactivate**. 

4. Hover over the sequence, and then select **More options** > **Edit**.

    > [!div class="mx-imgBorder"]
    > ![Select Edit](media/sequence-edit-select-edit.png "Select Edit")

5. Do one of the following:

    - To add an activity, perform **step 7** from [Create and activate a sequence](#create-and-activate-a-sequence), earlier in this article.
    
    - To edit an activity, select **More options** > **Edit**.

        > [!div class="mx-imgBorder"]
        > ![Edit an activity](media/sequence-edit-activity.png "Edit an activity")    

        Make the edits you want, and then select **Save**. 

6. (Optional) If you want the sequence to be available to connect with records, select **Activate**. 

7. Exit the sequence designer.

## Delete a sequence

You can delete sequences that your organization no longer needs, and they'll be deleted permanently from the app. You can delete active or inactive sequences. When you delete an active sequence, the records that were connected with the sequence will be disconnected from it.

**To delete a sequence**

1. Sign in to the **Sales Hub** app.

2. At the bottom of the site map, select **Change area** > **Sales Insights settings**.

3. Under **Acceleration**, select **Sequence (preview)**.

4. On the **Sequences (preview)** page, hover over the sequence you want to delete, and then select **More options** > **Delete**.

5. In the confirmation message that appears, select **Delete permanently**.
