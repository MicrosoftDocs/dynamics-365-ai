# Uninstall Sales Insights  
You can uninstall Sales Insights if you donâ€™t want to use in your organization. To uninstall, follow these steps:  
1.	As an administrator, sign in to your Dynamics 365 organization.   
2.	Go to **Advanced settings**, and then select **Settings** > **Customization** > **Solutions**.  
3.	On the **Solutions** page, select each solution from the list below, one at a time, and then select **Delete**.  
    -	msdyn_acceleratedsalessitemap  
    -	msdyn_acceleratedsales  
    -	msdyn_connectiongraph  
    -	msdyn_Conversationlntelligence  
    -	msdyn_PredictiveScoringCommon  
    -	msdyn_sequence  
    -	msdynce_RelationshipAssistantAddOn  
    -	PredictiveForecast  
    -	PredictiveLeadScoring  
    -	PredictiveOpportunityScoring  
    -	RelationshipAnalytics  
    -	SalesInsightsAddOn  
    -	SalesInsightsMDLConfig  
4.	Though you have deleted the solutions, your organization data might still be written to SalesInsightsMDLConfig solution. To completely delink Sales Insights to write your data, contact Dynamics 365 support.  

## What happens to data  
After you delete the solutions and decouple to writeback data, the Sales Insights will not retain any data that is related to your organization in the storage locations where it is hosted.
