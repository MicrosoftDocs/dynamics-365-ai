# Uninstall Sales Insights  
You can uninstall Sales Insights if you donâ€™t want to use in your organization. To uninstall, follow these steps:  
1.	As an administrator, sign in to your Dynamics 365 organization.   
2.	Go to **Advanced settings**, and then select **Settings** > **Customization** > **Solutions**.  
3.	On the **Solutions** page, select each solution from the list below, one at a time, and then select **Delete**.  
    -	msdyn_acceleratedsalessettings
    -   msdyn_acceleratedsalessitemap  
    -	msdyn_acceleratedsales  
    -	msdyn_connectiongraph  
    -	msdyn_Conversationlntelligence  
    -	msdyn_PredictiveScoringCommon 
    -   msdyn_sequence  
    -	msdynce_RelationshipAssistantAddOn  
    -	PredictiveForecast  
    -	PredictiveLeadScoring  
    -	PredictiveOpportunityScoring  
    -	RelationshipAnalytics  
    -	SalesInsightsAddOn  
    -	SalesInsightsMDLConfig  
4.	Though you've deleted the solutions, your organization data might still be written to Data Lake Storage. To completely remove data and reclaim the data storage, contact Dynamics 365 support.  

## What happens to data  
After you uninstall Sales Insights, the application won't keep any Sales Insights data of your organization in the storage locations where it's hosted.
