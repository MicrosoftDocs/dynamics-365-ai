The Dynamics 365 assistant app provides an integrated scan option that allows you to quickly create or add notes, contacts, and tasks. For example, when you complete a meeting with a potential customer, you can use the scan option to scan the business card and create a contact. You also can scan handwritten notes to generate tasks and notes in Dynamics 365 Sales.

> [!NOTE]
> You must have the **Common Data Service User** role assigned to you to use the business card and note scan control.

The app provides the following options:

-	[Scan business cards](#scan-business-cards)

-	[Scan meeting notes](#scan-meeting-notes)

## Scan business cards

The scan business card option helps you as a salesperson to quickly create contacts in the app and then store them in your Dynamics 365 Sales organization. When you scan a business card, it reads basic information from the card and populates data in the fields of lead or contact records in Dynamics 365 Sales. This helps you to spend your valuable time on more important tasks than entering data manually.

To scan a business card, follow these steps:

1.	Open the Dynamics 365 assistant app on Teams on mobile.

2.	On the home page, select **Add menu** (**+**). The options to scan slide from the bottom.

4.	Face the camera toward the business card and ensure that the card remains within the scan area (rectangular area). Snap a photo of the card. 

    The details of the card such as name, role, business email, business phone, and account are captured on the creation form.

    The contact is created in your Dynamics 365 Sales organization.
