## Free Sales Insights features 

These Sales Insights features are available for free with Dynamics 365 Sales: 

- **Assistant (free)**: The assistant (formerly known as Relationship assistant) combines and analyzes the information that is at its disposal from Dynamics 365 Sales, and then generates a collection of action cards that are displayed as your entry point to Dynamics 365 Sales on mobile devices, and as a carousel or column display on your web-based dashboards. To learn more, see  [Use assistant to guide customer communications](assistant.md). 

- **Auto capture (free)**: The auto capture analyzes your email messages directly in Microsoft Exchange to find all messages that might be relevant to your work in sales. The application looks for messages to or from relevant email addresses and presents you with the relevant messages right in Sales. To learn more, see [Auto capture of related emails](auto-capture.md). 

- **Email engagement (free)**: The email engagement helps you create more effective email messages—and learn how your contacts are interacting with them. Stay on top of your email and prioritize those prospects or customers that are most engaged. To learn more, see [Use email engagement to view message interactions](email-engagement.md).

## Sales Insights application 

The Sales Insights application provides you with the information and insights to intelligently manage the sales team, proactively coach sellers, and quickly answer questions regarding the business. To achieve this, the Dynamics 365 Sales Insights application provides you with information through key performance indicators (KPIs) for pipeline and deals, and intelligent call data KPIs through conversations intelligence. 

The features in the [!INCLUDE[pn-dynamics-sales-insights](../includes/pn-dynamics-sales-insights.md)] application are specifically designed to help sales managers and sellers to intelligently manage and quickly answer their most important business questions.

> [!NOTE]

The following features are available under the Dynamics 365 Sales Insights app:

To learn more, see [Improve seller coaching and sales potential with Dynamics 365 Sales Insights application](dynamics365-sales-insights-app.md).

## For effective use of Sales Insights

For effective use of Dynamics 365 Sales Insights, use the out-of-the-box entities (contact, opportunity, lead, account, and case) while creating records in the application. If changes to the entity are required in your organization, customize only these out-of-the-box entities to meet your requirements. This helps the application to analyze the records, and generate models and predictions effectively.
