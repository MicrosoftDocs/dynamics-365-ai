# Configure who knows whom

The Who knows whom feature helps users to quickly identify colleagues within their organization who can introduce them to leads or contacts.

>[!NOTE]
> Who knows whom is currently available only in the North American (NAM) region.

To configure who knows whom, follow these steps:

1. Verify that advanced Sales Insights features are enabled. To learn more, see [Install and configure premium Sales Insights features](intro-admin-guide-sales-insights.md#install-and-configure-premium-sales-insights-features). 

2.	Go to **Change area** and select **Sales Insights settings**.

    > [!div class="mx-imgBorder"]
    > ![Select Sales Insights settings option](media/si-admin-change-area-sales-insights-settings.png "Select Sales Insights settings option")

3.  On the sitemap, select **Who knows whom** under **Connection insights**.

    > [!TIP]
    > Alternatively, in the **Sales Insights settings** page, select **Set up** from the **Who knows whom** section to go to configuration page.

    The configuration page opens.

    > [!div class="mx-imgBorder"]
    > ![Who knows whom configuration page](media/si-admin-who-know-whom-configuration-page.png "Who knows whom configuration page")

4. On the **Who knows whom** section, select **Turn on Who Knows Whom for your organization**.

    > [!div class="mx-imgBorder"]
    > ![Enable who knows whom](media/si-admin-who-knows-whom-enable.png "Enable who knows whom")
        
5. Optionally, you can select an email template according to your organizational requirements. By default, an out-of-the-box email template will be selected.

6. Select **Save**.

   The who knows whom feature is configured and ready to use in your organization.

After you enable the who knows whom feature in your organization, verify that the connection graph is enabled in the admin center. This allows [!INCLUDE[pn-dyn-365-sales](../includes/pn-dyn-365-sales.md)] to collect the communication and collaboration details of users from Exchange server.

> [!NOTE]
> Contact your Office 365 administrator to enable the Dynamics 365 Sales Insights connection graph if you don't have sufficient privileges to enable.
