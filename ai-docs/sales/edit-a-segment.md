# Edit a segment    
To match latest changes in the process of choosing records, you can update the conditions that are defined in a segment. Follow these steps:   
1.	Sign in to your Dynamics 365 Sales Hub app.   
2.	Go to **Change area** in the lower-left corner of the page and select **Sales Insights settings**.
3.	Under **Sales accelerator**, select **Segments**.   
    The segments page opens with the list of available segments.   

    >[!div class="mx-imgBorder"]
    >![Segments page with list of segments](media/sa-segment-edit-list-lead-segments.png "Segments page with list of segments")  

4.	Select and open the segment that you want to edit. In this example, the **Leads from contact us** is selected.

    >[!div class="mx-imgBorder"]
    >![Select a lead to edit](media/sa-segment-edit-select-lead.png "Select a lead to edit")  
 
5.	Select **Edit**. 
6.	On the confirmation message, select **Edit**.

    >[!div class="mx-imgBorder"]
    >![Edit confirmation message](media/sa-segment-edit-lead-edit-confirmation.png "Edit confirmation message")  
  
7.	Edit the conditions and select **Save**.   
    A confirmation message is displayed.

    >[!div class="mx-imgBorder"]
    >![Save the edits confirmation message](media/sa-segment-edit-lead-edit-save-confirmation.png "Save the edits confirmation message")  
 
8.	On the confirmation message, select **Update segment**.   
    The changes will be applied on records that are going to be created in the application for this segment. The records that are already applied to this segment will not change.
