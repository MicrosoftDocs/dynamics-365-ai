# Edit a segment

To modify your process for choosing the records you want as members of a segment, you can update the conditions that you've defined in the segment.

1.	Sign in to your Dynamics 365 Sales Hub app.   
2.	Go to **Change area** in the lower-left corner of the page, and select **Sales Insights settings**.
3.	Under **Sales accelerator**, select **Segments**.   

    The **Segments** page opens with the list of available segments.   

    >[!div class="mx-imgBorder"]
    >![Segments page with a list of segments](media/sa-segment-edit-list-lead-segments.png "Segments page with a list of segments")  

4.	Select and open the segment that you want to edit. In this example, **Leads from contact us** is selected.

    >[!div class="mx-imgBorder"]
    >![Select a lead to edit](media/sa-segment-edit-select-lead.png "Select a lead to edit")  
 
5.	Select **Edit**. 
6.	On the confirmation message, select **Edit**.

    >[!div class="mx-imgBorder"]
    >![Edit confirmation message](media/sa-segment-edit-lead-edit-confirmation.png "Edit confirmation message")  
  
7.	Edit the conditions, select **Save**, and then in the confirmation message that appears, select **Update segment**.

    >[!div class="mx-imgBorder"]
    >![Save your edits](media/sa-segment-edit-lead-edit-save-confirmation.png "Save your edits")  

The changes will be applied to records that are created in the future in the application. The records that the segment has already been applied to won't change.
