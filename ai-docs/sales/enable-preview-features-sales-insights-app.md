# Enable coming soon features

Sometimes "coming soon" features that change the look, feel, or functionality of the application are added to conversation intelligence before the formal release.

As an administrator, activating **Coming soon** mode gives users in your organization early access to these new features, allowing them to share feedback with us before the changes are formally released. 

> [!IMPORTANT]
> If you’ve already enabled **Coming soon** mode during your first-run setup, you’re not required to enable it again; however, you can disable **Coming soon** mode in your organization if you don’t wish to experience the new features that are yet to be released.

## Open coming soon settings page

> [!NOTE]
> Review the prerequisites. To learn more, see [Prerequisites to configure conversation intelligence](prereq-sales-insights-app.md).
