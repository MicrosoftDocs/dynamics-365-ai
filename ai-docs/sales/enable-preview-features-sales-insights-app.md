Preview features aren't meant for production use and are subject to a separate [supplemental terms of use](https://go.microsoft.com/fwlink/p/?linkid=870960).

Sometimes "coming soon" features that change the look, feel, or functionality of the application are added to Conversation Intelligence before the formal release.

As an administrator, activating **Coming soon** mode gives users in your organization early access to these new features, allowing them to share feedback with us before the changes are formally released. 

> [!IMPORTANT]
> If you’ve already enabled **Coming soon** mode during your first-run setup, you’re not required to enable it again; however, you can disable **Coming soon** mode in your organization if you don’t wish to experience the new features that are yet to be released.

**Follow these steps to enable previews**:

1.	Review the prerequisites. To learn more, see [Prerequisites to configure Conversation Intelligence](prereq-sales-insights-app.md).

2.	Open the **Conversation Intelligence** application. 

3.	Select the **Settings** icon on the top-right of the page and then select **Settings**.

    > [!div class="mx-imgBorder"]
    > ![Select settings option](media/si-app-admin-select-settings.png "Select settings option")
 
4.	On the **Settings** page, select **Coming soon**.

    > [!div class="mx-imgBorder"]
    > ![Select coming soon option](media/si-app-admin-select-preview-feature.png "Select coming soon option")

5.	To enable, select **Get early access to new features before they’re released to all our customers** and then select **Save**.

    > [!div class="mx-imgBorder"]
    > ![Coming soon feature enabled](media/si-app-admin-preview-feature-enabled.png "Coming soon feature enabled")

    The **Coming soon** mode is enabled. Users in your organization can try out the new features that will be released later.
