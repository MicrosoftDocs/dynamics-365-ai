## What is Dynamics 365 Customer Insights?

Customer Insights is an intuitive and flexible customer data platform to unlock insights and power personalized customer experiences. It provides the capability to unify all customer data across the full range of sources to get a single view of customers.

Entity recognition of brands and social-demographic insights, two key capabilities from Market Insights Preview, will be used to enhance Customer Insights.
