# Data sources used in Dynamics 365 Market Insights

Market Insights looks at billions of data points from browser usage and search data to understand what consumers say, seek, and feel in an online world. Read on below to find out more about the different types of data.

## Search data

Market Insights uses data points from billions of searches which web users performed. All data points are **aggregated**, **anonymized**, **normalized**, and converted into signals and insights so no deduction to actual users is possible.

## Browse data

## News data

Market Insights uses a broad variety of international news sites based on Bing News that users visit frequently. Additionally, it analyzes incoming and outgoing traffic to these news sites.
