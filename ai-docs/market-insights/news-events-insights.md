# News insights

## News articles

Good business decisions are driven by good information. Business and sales professionals need to stay updated on their own and their customers' activities on a daily basis. However, it can be time costly to navigate individual websites in search of what's most relevant.

**News** provides a view that shows the three most relevant articles in your feed and gives you access to more information about them.
