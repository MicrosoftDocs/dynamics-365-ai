## Tips on refining your topic

Use the **Show Advanced** toggle to refine your search.

Add **more variations of the search term** to *broaden* your search. Example: You want to find generic news about the company Microsoft. When searching for Microsoft, consider searching for the stock ticker symbol (MSFT) too.

Add **inclusions** to *narrow* your search and find news that include both, the search term AND at least one of the terms in box. Example: You want to find news about the Microsoft's Power Platform, but not for generic power platforms.

Add **exclusions** to *narrow* your search and find news that include the search term but don't include the terms in the box. Example: You want to find news about car industry, but not about car accidents.
